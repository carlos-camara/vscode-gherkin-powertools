## [1.8.7] - 2026-10-11

### 🚀 Added
- **Test Explorer Focus Mode**: Clicking on a Test, Scenario, or Example row in the Test Explorer now triggers an automatic "Focus Mode" that illuminates the active block with a strong accent border in the editor. This makes the selected test instantly distinguishable from the surrounding code.

### 🐛 Fixed
- **Semantic Configuration Invalidation**: Fixed a major architecture issue where the `WorkspaceEventBus` exposed a broad `configurationChanged` event, causing discovery services to constantly drop cache state unnecessarily on unrelated formatting or diagnostic setting changes. Replaced entirely with a granular, diff-based event system (`stepDiscoveryConfigChanged`, `diagnosticsConfigChanged`, etc.), eliminating global cache thrashing while still maintaining flawless cache synchronization.
- **Exception Node Execution Scope**: Fixed an issue where clicking "Run" directly on a Test Explorer Exception node (e.g., `Failed at line X`) would inadvertently run the entire feature file instead of the isolated scenario. The line extractor now correctly handles exception node suffixes.
- **Linter False Positives on Short Keywords**: Fixed an aggressive typo diagnostic (Levenshtein distance) that incorrectly flagged short valid words (like `I` or `As`) as typos of Gherkin keywords.
- **Suppressions Schema Type**: Fixed a bug where `.gherkin-pt-suppressions.json` would show a "yellow squiggle" warning because its internal schema incorrectly expected a `string` instead of an `array` of objects.
- **Flaky CI Infrastructure**: Increased timeouts in the internal `DeferredBootstrap` integration test to resolve a race condition that incorrectly flagged cache rejection logic as "running" instead of "failed" on slower CI runners (e.g., macOS-latest).

## [1.8.6.1] - 2026-10-10
- **Multiline Step Definitions**: Fixed an issue where Behave step decorators containing multiline function calls with trailing commas (e.g. `@step(\n "name",\n)`) were incorrectly parsed, causing them to show as undefined steps in Gherkin files.
- **Component Initialization Race Condition**: Fixed a bug where a failed cache initialization promise would silently resolve, causing the workspace graph to incorrectly assume the initialization was successful and preventing backoff retry logic from triggering.

### 📚 Documentation
- **Comprehensive Docs Audit**: Performed a full repository-wide documentation audit. Updated `architecture.md` and `troubleshooting.md` to accurately document the new initialization rejection contract and troubleshooting strategies.

### 🧪 Tests
- **Integration Test Mocking**: Fixed a leaking workspace configuration mock in `conformance.test.ts` that caused downstream integration tests to incorrectly report 0 discovered feature files. Added a robust `try-finally` block ensuring proper test environment isolation.

### 📦 Dependencies
- Bumped various development and GitHub Actions dependencies to their latest versions (`markdown-it`, `undici`, `js-yaml`, `@types/vscode`, `@types/node`, `super-linter`, etc.) to improve security and maintainability.

## [1.8.6] - 2026-08-28

### 🚀 Added
- **Completion Intelligence Redesign**: Replaced the legacy `UsageIndexer` additive string-parsing model with a strict **5-tier Lexicographical Ranking model** backed by the `WorkspaceGraph`. Autocomplete suggestions are now deterministically ranked such that semantic text matching strictly outranks raw popularity, usage counts, and tag affinities.
- **Architectural Reliability**: The removal of `UsageIndexer` completely eliminates in-memory string parsing for feature files, deferring to the authoritative `WorkspaceGraph` state. This creates a mathematically robust, snapshot-driven model that correctly decrements metrics on deletion.
- **Stable Step Definition Identity**: Introduced `StepDefinitionId` to provide a mathematically sound, canonical identity for every parsed Python step. This guarantees perfect ambiguity resolution, impact analysis, and usage tracking across complex workspaces even when files are renamed or regex patterns overlap.
- **AST-Based Parameter Completion**: Refactored `Scenario Outline` parameter completion (e.g. `Given I type <...`) to use the core `AstRepository` instead of relying on brittle string scanning. This intrinsically resolves escaped pipes, handles localization properly, accurately merges multiple `Examples` tables, and prevents header bleed-over from adjacent scenarios.
- **JSON DocString Formatting**: Added intelligent formatting for JSON inside DocStrings. When the `gherkinPowerTools.docStrings.formatJson` setting is `auto` (default) or `tagged`, JSON contents will be validated and automatically formatted with correct indentation relative to the step.
- **Robust Syntax Fallback**: While active typing might temporarily break the Abstract Syntax Tree, the autocomplete engine now features an instantaneous, constrained regex fallback to guarantee perfectly fluid keystroke responses during mid-flight syntax errors.
- **Robust Regex Snippet Generation**: Re-architected autocomplete extraction for complex Python Behave regular expressions. It accurately transforms character classes, capture groups, and optionals into Snippet placeholders, and strictly validates the generated text against the original `RegExp` to prevent invalid syntaxes from being inserted. Unsupported constructs seamlessly fallback to a safe pattern preview.
- **Ambiguous Step Grouping UX**: Redesigned IntelliSense to elegantly group duplicate/ambiguous Python step definitions under a single suggestion. It clearly displays the match count (e.g., `2 matching definitions`) and aggregates concise source locations in the documentation panel, eliminating menu clutter while preserving mathematically sound usage tracking for all underlying identities.
- **Consistent Source Location Presentation**: Unified source path formatting across Hover, Autocomplete documentation, Impact Analysis Quick Picks, Health Dashboards, and Diagnostics. The new `SourceLocationPresenter` natively supports multi-root workspaces, securely rendering workspace-relative paths and dropping redundant prefixes to prevent exposing absolute disk paths or confusing developers.
- **O(1) Autocomplete Hot-Path**: Replaced O(N) line-by-line regex scanning during the interactive IntelliSense hot-path with a strict `CompletionContextCache`. The engine now fetches semantic tags and local step texts directly from the memoized AST, binding the context snapshot to the document version. Subsequent completions fetch this context in ~0.0004ms, rendering the autocomplete engine completely independent of file size.
- **Impact-Aware Native Rename**: Re-architected the global step rename provider (<kbd>F2</kbd>) to support progressive disclosure. Renaming a high-impact step (affecting multiple files or many scenarios) now intercepts the edit and safely triggers VS Code's native Refactor Preview pane, allowing developers to manually review the exact blast radius before committing changes.
- **Ambiguous CodeLens Impact**: The CodeLens will now explicitly display `⚠️ Impact: Ambiguous` for Python step definitions that are involved in step collisions, actively highlighting ambiguity in the implementation file.

### 🐛 Fixed
- **Relaxed Ambiguity Usage Policy**: Implemented a relaxed usage policy that registers and tracks usages for ambiguous step definitions correctly, ensuring they do not misleadingly fall back to "Unused".
- **Structural Alias Quick Fix**: Added a structural detection and Quick Fix that safely identifies and strictly converts misuses of the `Examples` or `Scenarios` keywords back to valid `Scenario` keywords to enforce BDD best practices.

## [1.8.5] - 2026-08-24

### 🚀 Added
- **Anti-Pattern Engine Redesign**: Completely overhauled the BDD Anti-Pattern detection engine with a structured rule contract separating objective Correctness errors from subjective Reliability, Maintainability, and Style heuristics.
- **Finding Suppression System**: You can now safely suppress deliberate or unavoidable anti-patterns using a Quick Fix (`Cmd+.`). Suppressions are stored in a centralized, machine-readable `.gherkin-pt-suppressions.json` ledger, keeping your editor clean without losing track of technical debt. Manual edits to this file update your diagnostics in real-time.
- **Batch Fix Workflow**: Introduced the `Fix All Safe Gherkin Issues in File` command. Utilizing VS Code's `SourceFixAll` API, it deterministically resolves non-overlapping structural errors (like missing colons or exact keyword corrections) across an entire document in one safe atomic operation.
- **Object-based Rule Configuration**: `gherkinPowerTools.rules` now accepts configuration objects (e.g., `{ "severity": "error", "maxSteps": 20 }`), allowing teams to easily tweak subjective thresholds like `maxSteps` without being overwhelmed by low-value settings.
- **Workspace-Aware Step Destination**: Redesigned step definition generation to intelligently infer the optimal destination directory based on the project's `stepGlobs` configuration.
  The extension now respects your workspace architecture instead of blindly writing to `features/steps`, falling back to a clean QuickPick menu to resolve ambiguity.
  Generated files are automatically saved, instantly clearing undefined step diagnostics without requiring manual intervention.
- **Safe Concurrent Code Generation**: Step definition generation (Quick Fix) now enforces strict `{ overwrite: false }` bounds and prioritizes in-memory document state to definitively eliminate silent overwrites and race conditions when bootstrapping new features.
- **Range Formatting Safe-Unit Model**: Redesigned range formatting expansion to significantly reduce unintended formatting blast radius. The algorithm now groups non-splittable elements (Data Tables, DocStrings, and Tag Blocks) into isolated safe units, ensuring a selection of two independent steps no longer formats the entire encompassing Scenario.
- **Range Formatting Integrity**: Strengthened the VS Code range formatting API by enforcing strict idempotency guarantees and AST boundary reparsing to prevent syntax corruption during partial formatting.
- **AST Caching Redesign**: Replaced the rigid count-based AST cache with a dynamic **Weighted LRU Cache** enforcing a 50MB soft memory budget.
  This allows the extension to safely scale across massive enterprise workspaces (>10,000 files) by estimating AST byte sizes and shedding oldest documents only when real memory pressure demands it, drastically improving hit ratios without exhausting the VS Code Extension Host.
- **Robust Parser Loader**: Audited and redesigned the dynamic loader for `@cucumber/gherkin` and `@cucumber/messages` to include a bounded retry strategy. This improves extension resilience during transient filesystem errors or Extension Host initialization failures.
- **Concurrent Loader Deduplication**: Prevented multiple concurrent parser triggers from creating duplicate loader instances.
- **Unified Diagnostics Model**: Replaced divergent `linter.enabledRules` and `antiPatterns.rules` configuration objects with a single, authoritative `gherkinPowerTools.rules` dictionary. All diagnostic identifiers have been standardized to `kebab-case` across the AST linter and Anti-Pattern Engine. Legacy settings are automatically migrated at runtime.

### ✨ Improved
- **Code Action Reliability**: Completely redesigned how the Linter transmits machine data to Quick Fixes.
  By leveraging a strict internal `diagnosticRegistry` and validating document versions, the extension now guarantees that generating an undefined step or fixing a typo will never silently apply a stale payload or corrupt your document if you continue typing before clicking the lightbulb.
- **Linter Invalidation Redesign**: Replaced instantaneous file-event handlers with a centralized `invalidationQueue`.
  The Linter now intelligently batches multiple file events (e.g., rapid document saves or `stepDefinitionsUpdated`) and executes AST parsing concurrently with a strict concurrency limit (maximum 5 documents).
  This completely eliminates CPU starvation and Extension Host freezing during massive branch switches or global dependency updates.
- **Disabled Linter Lifecycle**: When `gherkinPowerTools.linter.enabled` is set to `false`, the extension now natively suppresses debounce timers, avoids `AstRepository` parsing, and silences all background notification popups. This guarantees true zero-overhead on CPU and memory when you rely exclusively on external linters.
- **Formatter Error UX Separation**: Automatic formatting (like Format on Save) is now strictly silent when a Gherkin document contains structural syntax errors, preventing intrusive warning popups from interrupting typing. Manual formatting commands via the Command Palette proactively display one concise, actionable warning when syntax errors block formatting.
- **MetricsLogger Optimization**: The Developer Metrics engine now queries the `metricsEnabled` setting via an event-driven configuration listener instead of polling VS Code on every log event. This eliminates synchronous IPC overhead, improving hot path performance during massive AST parsing by over 2.4x while keeping disabled log events strictly allocation-light.
- **Parser Metrics**: Added `Cache Evictions` and `Cache Est. Memory (MB)` to the Developer Metrics output to provide observability into the new memory budgeting logic.
- **Parser Reliability**: Fixed an issue where a temporarily failed module load would permanently break the parser by caching the rejected promise. The cache is now correctly evicted on failure, allowing seamless automatic recovery on subsequent parses.

### 🐛 Fixed
- **Structural Step Identity Validation**: Fixed a bug where step definition patterns containing colons (`:`) or complex regex characters were incorrectly parsed by the Anti-Pattern Engine.
  The structural identity model now leverages nested object structures instead of string-based delimiter serialization, fully eliminating false-positive "Duplicated Steps" warnings and data corruption on valid Python expressions.

### 📚 Documentation
- **Comprehensive Documentation Audit**: Performed a repository-wide documentation audit for the 1.8.5 release.
  Verified that the new Anti-Pattern Engine rules (Correctness, Maintainability, Style), the centralized `gherkinPowerTools.rules` configuration,
  the batch quick fix workflow (`Fix All Safe Gherkin Issues in File`), and the diagnostic suppression ledger (`.gherkin-pt-suppressions.json`) are thoroughly and accurately documented across all MKDocs pages and the README.

## [1.8.4] - 2026-08-22

### 💅 User Experience & Polish
- **Modern Dashboard**: The Gherkin Health Dashboard has been completely redesigned with a strict modern aesthetic for a premium, responsive, and minimalist native feel.
- **CodeLens Simplification**: Impact Analysis CodeLens now navigates directly to the exact step (instead of the scenario top) and uses a simplified path display for better readability.
- **Cross-Platform Quick Fixes**: Updated Quick Fixes and walkthroughs to explicitly support both macOS (`Cmd+.`) and Windows (`Ctrl+.`) shortcuts.
- **Immediate Linter Diagnostics**: The Gherkin Linter now executes instantaneously upon opening a file, bypassing the standard typing debounce. This ensures warnings (like ambiguous steps) appear immediately without requiring you to type or switch tabs.
- **Refined Ambiguous Step Diagnostics**: Injected a clear `⚠️` emoji into the native VS Code diagnostic string (`⚠️ Ambiguous step: matches multiple definitions...`) and removed the redundant header from the hover provider to ensure a clean, single-warning UI.

### 🚀 Architecture & Reliability
- **Authoritative Feature Discovery**: Implemented a central `FeatureDiscoveryService` that acts as the single source of truth for all `*.feature` files in the workspace. This resolves inconsistencies between the Extension Cache, Test Explorer, CLI, and Diagnostics by unifying file watchers, respecting ignore globs (`gherkinPowerTools.featureGlobs`), and debouncing file I/O bursts.
- **Optimized Behave File Discovery**: The `BehaveFileDiscoveryService` now caches active glob patterns and only reconstructs file system watchers when the resolved configuration actually changes. In multi-root workspaces, it precisely targets only the affected roots, and aggressively deduplicates overlapping concurrent file system events into a single pending state per URI.
- **Transactional Workspace Graph**: The core semantic index (`WorkspaceGraph`) has been completely redesigned around an immutable, transactional generation model (`WorkspaceGraphGeneration`). Readers (like the Impact Analyzer and Test Explorer) now query a stable, immutable snapshot of the graph,
  while writers use an atomic `executeTransaction` queue that strictly isolates state, eliminates race conditions, and safely aborts stale file updates during heavy workspace I/O.
- **Capability-Based Deferred Bootstrap**: Hardened the extension startup sequence. `DeferredBootstrap` now orchestrates initialization using isolated Capabilities rather than a monolithic `Promise.all()`.
- **Stable Parser Error Contract**: Introduced a unified `GherkinParseError` interface across the parser, linter, graph, and statistics engines. This strictly normalizes `@cucumber/gherkin` composite errors, eliminating cascading crashes during malformed document edits.
- **Syntax Errors Anti-Pattern**: The BDD Anti-pattern Detection Engine now actively surfaces parser `syntax-errors` to block execution on invalid Gherkin files.
- **Cross-Platform Resource Canonicalization**: Redesigned internal cache mechanisms and Graph queries to use a strict `ResourceIdentity` abstraction. Correctly handles URI canonicalization and prevents cache poisoning/collisions across case-sensitive (Linux, Remote SSH) and case-insensitive (macOS, Windows) filesystems.
  This crucially fixes silent failures where **Impact Analysis CodeLenses** and **Rename Step** features would not appear on macOS/Windows.
- **Resilient Cache Initialization**: Implemented bounded exponential retries for I/O-bound indexers (Symbol Cache, Usage Indexer), allowing them to automatically recover from transient read errors (e.g., file locks) without crashing the extension.
- **Diagnostic Observability**: The `Diagnose Workspace` command now reports the real-time status of every bootstrap capability, providing unprecedented visibility into startup failures.

### 🛡️ Security & Release Engineering
- **Strict Execution Boundaries**: Safely eliminated the implicit `workspaceFolders[0]` fallback for external/untitled files. Test execution requests for `.feature` files located outside of active workspaces are now explicitly blocked to protect the user's root disk from arbitrary runs.
- **Multi-Root Target Prompting**: Step definition generation (Quick Fixes) will now present an explicit `QuickPick` folder selection dialog if multiple roots are available and the file context is ambiguous, rather than silently writing to the first project.

### 📚 Documentation
- **Comprehensive Documentation Audit**: Performed a repository-wide documentation audit. Verified that the Gherkin Health Dashboard, Real-Time Impact Analysis, Anti-pattern Detection Engine, Contextual Feature Discovery, and the standalone CLI (`@carlos-camara/gherkin-pt`) are thoroughly and accurately documented across the README, MKDocs, getting started guides, and command references.
- **Markdown Linting Compliance**: Fixed markdown linting line-length errors (`MD013`) in the Run and Debug documentation to guarantee CI/CD compliance.

### 🛡️ Security & Release Engineering
- **Provenance Hardening**: Implemented rigorous cryptographic validation to enforce a strict immutable relationship between the source commit, git tag, generated `.vsix`, and GitHub Release asset.
- **Supply Chain Protection**: Redesigned the GitHub Actions `release.yml` into a decoupled, dual-job workflow. Unprivileged jobs build the extension, while a privileged job publishes it, ensuring that no `npm install` or build scripts ever have access to the `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
- **Anti-Clobbering Mechanics**: Eliminated silent release overwrites. The pipeline now verifies the SHA-256 of any existing release assets and aborts immediately if a tampered or duplicate VSIX is detected, forcing manual intervention.
- **Internal Manifest Validation**: The VSIX generation process now strictly extracts and matches the packaged `extension/package.json` against the repository source of truth to detect internal tampered versions before publication.

## [1.8.3] - 2026-08-18

### 🚀 Added
- **Secure Execution Model**: Redesigned Behave test execution (`gherkinPowerTools.behave.execution`) to use structured arguments and `spawn({ shell: false })` instead of raw shell commands, mitigating command injection risks.
- **Workspace Trust**: Integrated VS Code's Workspace Trust API to explicitly block automated Behave execution in untrusted environments.
- **Machine-Specific Configuration Isolation**: Added `gherkinPowerTools.behave.localExecutable` as a strict, machine-specific configuration override for execution, ensuring absolute paths are not committed to shared project configuration files.
- **Scoped CLI Package**: The Standalone CLI is now distributed as a secure, dedicated scoped npm package (`@carlos-camara/gherkin-pt`). This eliminates supply chain squatting risks and ensures the executable name does not conflict with global namespace packages.

### ✨ Improved
- **Native Step Rename Alignment**: Removed custom keybindings for renaming steps. The native VS Code `F2` rename provider is now fully responsible for Gherkin step renaming, enabling native previews, robust `WorkspaceEdit` undo history, and seamless UI integration without hijacking standard editor keys.
- **Safe Shortcut Chords**: Command Center, Gherkin Health, and Workspace Diagnostics have been reassigned to non-conflicting shortcuts (`Alt+Shift+G`, `Alt+Shift+H`, `Alt+Shift+D`) so they no longer interfere with native VS Code panels like Source Control.
- **Extension Isolation**: Removed an activation-time side effect where the extension recommended and potentially modified the global VS Code `testing.automaticallyOpenPeekView` setting. This ensures Gherkin PowerTools strictly isolates its test view state without inadvertently altering the user's experience with other test controllers (like Python or Jest).
- **First-Run Experience**: Completely redesigned the onboarding Walkthroughs into three distinct, tailored journeys: *Essential BDD*, *Python Behave*, and *CLI & CI*. The Behave journey now automatically hides configuration steps if auto-discovery succeeds, accelerating time-to-first-value.
- **Editor Context Menu Redesign**: Drastically reduced clutter in the editor right-click menu. Workspace-level actions (Format, Diagnose, Health) have been grouped into a dedicated `Gherkin PowerTools` submenu. Additionally, the `Rename Step` command now uses dynamic context keys to appear *only* when your cursor is positioned on a valid Gherkin step.
- **Command Architecture Standardization**: All commands have been unified under the `gherkinPowerTools` namespace and the `Gherkin PowerTools` category for consistency in the Command Palette. The legacy `gherkin-powertools.showImpactDetails` command has been deprecated and aliased to `gherkinPowerTools.showImpactDetails` to prevent breaking existing keybindings.
- **Deferred Activation Lifecycle**: Replaced insecure `setTimeout` usage with a deterministic `DeferredBootstrap` state machine using cancellation tokens. This guarantees that heavy workspace parsing is safely deferred without blocking VS Code startup and can be reliably cancelled during extension deactivation.
- **CLI Documentation**: Fully updated documentation across README, CLI guides, and Getting Started pages to reflect the new `npx @carlos-camara/gherkin-pt` execution model.

### 🐛 Fixed
- **Remote Environment Compatibility**: Fixed a critical bug where the Gherkin parser failed silently on Dev Containers and Remote SSH environments.
  The extension now natively bundles ES Module dependencies (`@cucumber/gherkin` and `@cucumber/messages`) into the production CommonJS output.
  This eliminates runtime module resolution failures without ballooning the VSIX file size, and permanently restores Formatting, Gherkin Health, and Test Explorer features on remote machines.
- **Zero-Config Python Environment Detection**: Completely removed the deprecated `behave.command` setting to enforce a zero-config paradigm. Behave execution now automatically discovers virtual environments by directly leveraging the official Microsoft Python extension API. This eliminates the need to hardcode absolute environment paths and automatically migrates legacy configurations on startup.
- **CLI Dependency Resolution**: Fixed an issue where the standalone CLI could fail to resolve peer dependencies like `@cucumber/gherkin` when executed via `npx`. The build script now natively injects root workspace dependencies into the CLI's `package.json`.
- **Test Explorer Integration**: Removed an invalid global `testing.showCoverageInExplorer` configuration override from the extension manifest. This prevents Gherkin PowerTools from inadvertently hiding the coverage buttons of other third-party extensions (like Python Pytest or Jest) in the VS Code Test Explorer.
- **Linter Edge Case**: Fixed a semantic validation bug where misspelled step keywords were not highlighted if they were incorrectly parsed as part of a Feature or Rule description due to missing colons (e.g., a missing colon on a `Scenario`).

## [1.8.2] - 2026-08-05

### 🚀 Added
- **Command Line Interface (CLI) Conformance**: The standalone CLI now features 100% execution parity with the VS Code extension by leveraging a unified `defaults.ts` configuration layer.
- **Strict Configuration Hierarchy**: Enforced a clear precedence pipeline across the extension and CLI (Project `.gherkin-powertoolsrc.json` > Workspace Settings > User Settings > Defaults) via centralized configuration resolution.
- **BDD Anti-pattern Detection Engine**: A powerful new static analysis engine replacing the legacy Recommendation Engine. It proactively scans your entire workspace to detect and surface anti-patterns such as Oversized Features, Oversized Scenarios, Duplicated/Unused/Ambiguous/Undefined Python step definitions, Excessive Tags, and Inconsistent Formatting.
  - Fully configurable via `gherkinPowerTools.antiPatterns.rules` to set severities (`error`, `warning`, `info`, `hint`, `off`) for individual rules.
  - Safely integrates with the Real-time Linter to prevent double-squiggles on feature files.
- **Case-Insensitive URI Normalization**: Implemented robust case-insensitive path normalization across the `WorkspaceGraph` and `SymbolCache` for macOS and Windows, fixing false positives where files were seen as duplicates or missed entirely.

### ✨ Improved
- **Anti-Pattern Step Keyword Extraction**: Refined the duplicate and unused step detection algorithms. The engine now dynamically normalizes step keywords (Given/When/Then), preventing false positives when identical regular expressions are registered with different decorators to support multiple execution contexts.
- **Semantic Ambiguous Step Resolution**: Fixed a major bug in the Ambiguous Step Linter. Continuation steps using `And` or `But` now accurately inherit their parent `Given`, `When`, or `Then` semantic type, preventing false-positive Ambiguous or Unused step warnings when multiple steps share the same regular expression pattern but use different decorators.
- **Historical Trends Persistence**: Hardened the Gherkin Health Dashboard metrics storage. The history is now rigorously versioned (`HistorySchemaV1`), fully deduplicated to conserve space, and smartly isolated per Git branch to prevent cross-branch contamination of project metrics. Added `Export History as JSON` and `Clear History` commands.
- **Performance Optimization**: Removed the computationally heavy `suspiciousSimilarities` check from the background analyzer and removed `ts-node` dependency to improve extension host memory usage and reduce bundle size.

### 🐛 Fixed
- **UI Error Deduplication**: Deduplicated consecutive lines in test error output to prevent `behave` from spamming the Test Explorer console.
- **Diagnostic Line Alignment**: Prevented an off-by-one line shift in Python files when rendering inline squiggles from the Anti-pattern engine.
- **Dashboard Styling**: Fixed CSS severity classes for badges to ensure Anti-pattern severities display the correct colors in the HTML dashboard.
- **CLI Output**: Updated Standalone CLI output terminology and test assertions to match the new Anti-pattern rules.

### 📖 Documentation
- **Visual Overhaul**: Applied a new glassmorphism and soft-shadow styling to the MkDocs documentation.
- **Hero Image Update**: Swapped the main hero GIF in the README to showcase the Test Explorer execution & debugging.
- **Content Restructuring**: Re-organized and numbered the "Two-Tiered Capabilities" and "Detailed Features" lists in the README.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-08-03

### 🚀 Added
- **Real-Time Impact Analysis Engine**: Added a new blast radius impact analyzer that places an interactive CodeLens above every Python step definition.
  It calculates how many scenarios depend on a step, grouping them by severity (High, Medium, Low, or Unused).
  Clicking the CodeLens opens a QuickPick menu to instantly navigate to the affected scenarios, significantly reducing the risk of refactoring.
  This feature can be disabled via the `gherkinPowerTools.impactAnalysis.enabled` setting.
- **Automated First-Run Experience**: Added an intelligent, non-intrusive onboarding experience. When you open a Python Behave project for the first time, Gherkin PowerTools automatically detects it, counts your features, and presents a welcome notification with quick actions to launch the Walkthrough or the Health Dashboard.
- **Contextual Feature Discovery**: A lightweight, non-intrusive recommendation engine that analyzes your workflow in real-time. It seamlessly surfaces advanced features (like generating missing steps, auto-formatting tables, opening the command center, or checking project health) at the exact moment you need them, without disrupting your flow. Includes "Don't show again" functionality.
- **Historical Trend Analysis**: Gherkin Health Dashboard now automatically tracks and persists lightweight historical snapshots of your project metrics in the workspace state. It visualizes project evolution (complexity, maintainability, technical debt) over time using interactive charts without sending any data off your machine. Configure retention policies or disable it entirely in settings.
- **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: Gherkin PowerTools now includes a powerful, standalone CLI (`@carlos-camara/gherkin-pt`) that brings the Workspace Intelligence Engine to your terminal and CI/CD pipelines.
  - Run `npx @carlos-camara/gherkin-pt analyze` to enforce Gherkin structural validity and block missing Python steps in Pull Requests.
  - Run `npx @carlos-camara/gherkin-pt format --check` to enforce team formatting rules in CI.
  - Run `npx @carlos-camara/gherkin-pt stats --json` to export high-level project metrics.

### 🐛 Fixed
- Fixed an issue where the new Gherkin Health Dashboard failed to load the charting library in some VS Code environments due to `acquireVsCodeApi` strictness.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-07-30

### 🚀 Added
- **Gherkin Health Dashboard**: Redesigned the Statistics feature into a comprehensive Gherkin Health Dashboard that measures Complexity, Maintainability, and Technical Debt (unused/duplicate/undefined steps). The dashboard operates in $O(1)$ time by leveraging the new in-memory `WorkspaceGraph`. Includes a premium Glassmorphism UI redesign with fluid animations and responsive states.
- **Recommendation Engine**: Introduced a dedicated expert rules engine (`RecommendationEngine`) that statically analyzes your project and provides actionable insights (e.g. flagging Undefined Steps, Ambiguous Steps, Duplicated Steps, and Oversized Scenarios).
- **Integrated Step Analysis**: The legacy "Analyze Step Definitions" command has been fully integrated into the Gherkin Health Dashboard for a unified experience.
- **Smart Context-Aware Completion**: Python Behave step autocomplete is now incredibly smart. Instead of sorting suggestions alphabetically, Gherkin PowerTools now uses an intelligent ranking algorithm that tracks your recent usage, understands the current active feature, and prioritizes steps based on contextual tag affinity.
  This makes writing scenarios significantly faster as the most relevant steps are always at the top of the list.
- **Centralized AST Repository**: Completely redesigned the internal Gherkin parsing architecture. The extension now uses a centralized `AstRepository` that caches the parsed Abstract Syntax Tree per document version.
  This eliminates redundant CPU-intensive parsing operations across multiple features (formatting, linting, hover, autocomplete), drastically reducing CPU usage and improving editor responsiveness, especially in large `.feature` files.
- **Thundering Herd Protection**: The new parsing architecture prevents multiple language features from simultaneously triggering parsing on the exact same keystroke, creating a perfectly smooth typing experience.
- **Parser Diagnostics & Performance Metrics**: A new lightweight metrics engine that tracks parsing duration, cache hit ratios, document complexity, and parser failures in real-time. Enable via `gherkinPowerTools.diagnostics.metricsEnabled` and view using the **Show Developer Metrics** command.
- **Workspace Relationship Graph**: Implemented an event-driven `WorkspaceGraph` that maps structural relationships between Features, Scenarios, Rules, and Python Step Definitions in memory. This enables O(1) query capabilities for "Go To Definition" and "Hover" operations, entirely eliminating redundant regex scanning across the workspace.
- **Step Definition Analysis Dashboard**: Added a comprehensive, interactive webview dashboard (`Gherkin PowerTools: Analyze Step Definitions`) to help you keep your Python steps clean.
  It proactively indexes the workspace to detect unused steps (grouped by Python file), duplicated implementations, ambiguous step usages, and suspiciously similar regex patterns.
  Features click-to-navigate for all file references.

## [1.7.9] - 2026-07-29

### 🚀 Added
- **Live Step Tracking**: The Test Explorer now visually animates the execution of your scenarios. As Behave runs your tests in the background, the exact step currently executing lights up dynamically in your `.feature` file!
- **On-the-Fly Context Snapshot**: The Test Explorer now automatically inspects your Behave `context` at the end of every scenario. A beautifully formatted snapshot of your final variables is instantly injected into the Test Output panel, eliminating the need to attach a debugger just to see internal state.
- **Centralized Workspace Event Bus**: Implemented a robust internal event bus (`src/eventBus.ts`) to decouple file watchers and VS Code workspace events from feature modules. This architecture prevents memory leaks, ensures unified event processing, and simplifies the addition of new workspace-aware features.

### ✨ Improved
- **Test Explorer Navigation**: Clicking on a Scenario or Feature in the Test Explorer now intuitively navigates directly to its definition in the `.feature` file instead of jumping to the underlying Python step implementation.
- **Execution Output Clutter**: When a scenario fails during a test run, the error message and stack trace are no longer expanded automatically in the editor. They remain collapsed by default to prevent visual clutter, and can be viewed by explicitly clicking the error in the Test Explorer.

### 🐛 Fixed
- **Forceful Test Cancellation**: Fixed an issue where clicking the "Stop" button in the Test Explorer wouldn't reliably terminate frozen or long-running tests. The runner now uses a forceful `SIGKILL` signal to guarantee the underlying Python process is immediately destroyed.
- **Test Explorer Console Output**: Fixed an issue where `print()` statements and standard output were hidden during Test Explorer executions. The extension now forces Behave to stream all output natively (`--no-capture`), ensuring that prints are immediately visible in the VS Code Test Results panel, even for passing scenarios.
- **Windows CI Flakiness**: Fixed a critical race condition in the End-to-End test suite on Windows. `SymbolCache` now automatically invalidates its index and performs a deterministic synchronous scan whenever `stepGlobs` configuration changes, rather than relying on unreliable file-system creation events.

## [1.7.8] - 2026-07-28

### 🚀 Added
- **Command Center**: A unified interactive QuickPick menu to access all extension capabilities (formatting, execution, debugging, step navigation, and diagnostics) from a single place. Open it via `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) -> "Gherkin PowerTools: Command Center".
- **Native Test Explorer Integration**: Replaced the legacy CodeLens execution buttons with a full, native integration into the VS Code Testing sidebar (Test Explorer). You can now view, run, and debug Features, Rules, Scenarios, and Examples from a dedicated hierarchical tree.
- **Examples Execution**: You can now execute and debug individual rows within `Examples` tables! The extension injects non-intrusive Run (`▶`) and Debug (`🐞`) icons aligned to the left of each data row in the editor, and lists them as separate test nodes in the Test Explorer.
- **Interactive Execution Arguments Persistence**: Added a dedicated `Edit Behave args & Run` toolbar button (pencil icon) in the Test Explorer. It provides an interactive dialog letting you choose whether to save custom parameters (e.g., `--tags=@wip`) permanently to Workspace Settings or keep them volatile for the current session.
- **Security & Reliability Hardening for Execution**: Execution and debugging actions now use VS Code Tasks and array-based `ProcessExecution` APIs, entirely eliminating shell injection vulnerabilities for malicious or complex file paths.
  Additionally, interpreter detection now dynamically prioritizes your active `ms-python.python` environment to guarantee reliability.
- **Test Explorer Real-Time Tree Updates**: The Testing sidebar tree now refreshes **as you type** in a `.feature` file, without requiring a save. The internal controller subscribes to text changes with a 400 ms debounce, so new, renamed, or deleted scenarios appear instantly.
- **Instant Activation (O(1))**: The extension now activates instantly upon opening VS Code. Heavy workspace parsing (Python steps and Feature file tagging) has been successfully offloaded to background threads.
  This ensures that features like formatting and syntax highlighting are immediately available without blocking the extension host, dramatically improving startup times in massive enterprise projects.
- **Debug Console Auto-Focus**: When launching a debug session via the Test Explorer, VS Code now automatically switches focus to the **Debug Console** panel so you immediately see Behave's output and any assertion errors without navigating there manually.

### 🐛 Fixed
- **Linter Error Cascading**: Fixed a bug where a single missing colon (e.g., in `Scenario`) would completely break the internal Gherkin AST parser state, resulting in a massive wall of false-positive red squiggles on perfectly valid steps and tables below the error. The linter now intelligently suppresses cascading syntax errors to pinpoint exactly where the true structural error occurred.
- **Test Explorer Robustness**: Refactored the test discovery engine to use a resilient, dialect-aware text scanner instead of relying solely on the AST parser. This guarantees that all valid scenarios will always display execution buttons, even if previous syntax errors in the file break the parser.
- **Test Explorer Language Compatibility**: Fixed a bug where test detection would silently fail if the VS Code language identifier was manually set to `gherkin` instead of `feature`. The extension now fully supports both language IDs.
- **DevContainer Compatibility**: Fixed a bug where saving interactive execution arguments permanently to Workspace Settings would fail to apply inside DevContainers or multi-root workspaces. The settings are now correctly scoped to the active Workspace Folder's `.vscode/settings.json`.
- **Debug Mode: Test Results Pollution**: Fixed a critical UX regression where triggering a debug session from the Test Explorer was incorrectly recorded as a completed test run inside the **Test Results** panel.
  This caused previously-passing scenarios to appear as `Skipped (—)` after a debug session, destroying the valid green ✅ history. Debug sessions are now handled as a pure debugging workflow. They never write to the Test Results history.
- **Debug Session Spinner Stuck (Race Condition)**: Fixed a subtle race condition where the debug session started so quickly that `onDidStartDebugSession` fired before the extension's listener was registered — causing the Test Explorer spinner to never stop. The listener is now registered **before** `startDebugging()` is awaited, guaranteeing the event is never missed.
- **Debug Session Stuck on Failure**: Resolved a persistent issue where, if a Behave scenario **failed** during a debug session, the Test Explorer spinner would remain active indefinitely. The fix uses object-identity tracking (comparing `session` references, not string names) to reliably detect session termination, since the Python extension may rename debug session metadata internally.
- **Edit Args Applied Uniformly**: Confirmed and documented that custom execution arguments are consistently applied to **both** `Run` and `Debug` invocations, as both share the same argument resolution pipeline in `execution.ts`.

### 🧹 Maintenance
- **Dead Code Removal**: Removed 10 temporary scratch JavaScript files (`test_parse_error.js`, `test_linter_debug.js`, etc.) from the project root that accumulated during internal debugging sessions.
- **Test File Cleanup**: Removed unused import declarations and unused parameters from `config-listener.test.ts` and `linter.test.ts` to achieve zero warnings under `--noUnusedLocals --noUnusedParameters` TypeScript compiler flags.

## [1.7.7] - 2026-07-23

### 🚀 Added
- **Interactive Execution Arguments Persistence**: `Edit Scenario/Feature` CodeLens commands now provide an interactive dialog letting you choose whether to save custom parameters (e.g., `--tags=@wip`) permanently to the Workspace Settings or keep them volatile for the current session.
- **Behave Debugging CodeLens**: Debug features and scenarios directly from the editor using new `🐞 Debug` CodeLens buttons.
  The extension automatically detects your Python interpreter via the official Python extension and constructs a temporary launch configuration to seamlessly pause at breakpoints in your Python step definitions.
- **Single Typed Configuration Contract & Precedence Pipeline**:
  Configuration resolution now strictly enforces property-level precedence: Project (`.gherkin-powertoolsrc.json`) > Workspace Settings > User Settings > Defaults. Partial project config files now seamlessly inherit unmentioned fields from workspace/user settings.

### 🐛 Fixed
- **Automated CI Configuration Drift Guard**: Added `check:config` task and CI verification step (`scripts/check-config-sync.js`) that enforces 100% synchronization between implemented settings, JSON schema, `package.json`, and documentation.
- **Gherkin: Diagnose Workspace Command**: Added a new diagnostic command (`gherkinPowerTools.diagnoseWorkspace`)
  that analyzes environment versions, workspace layout, discovered feature/step files, indexed definitions, Python extension status, and `.gherkin-powertoolsrc.json` validity.
  Generates an Output Channel report with a 1-click `Copy Sanitized Report` action that redacts personal usernames and home directory paths for safe issue reporting.
- **Automated First-Run Onboarding Experience (Issue #169)**: Added a testable onboarding engine (`src/onboarding.ts`)
  that detects Python Behave projects (via step files, decorators, `environment.py`, and dependency manifests), checks `stepGlobs` coverage, and offers non-blocking 1-click recommendations to apply settings or create `.gherkin-powertoolsrc.json` without modifying files unconfirmed or interrupting non-Behave Gherkin projects.
- **Dedicated Visual Demo Gallery**: Added a standalone `docs/demos.md` gallery showcasing all feature animations.

- **Behave Step File Watching & Discovery Alignment (Issue #137)**: Redesigned file system watching logic
  so watchers are built dynamically per workspace folder using resolved `behave.stepGlobs` configuration.
  Standardized ignore glob filtering (`behave.ignoreGlobs`) across initial discovery and live events
  (creation, modification, deletion, rename), added 100ms per-URI event debouncing, and ensured clean watcher
  disposal and rebuilds on configuration changes.
- **MkDocs Snippet Path Resolution**: Fixed MkDocs site building errors for root inclusions (such as `README.md`) by configuring snippet base path resolution across `docs/` and root directories.
- **Dependency Security Vulnerabilities**: Pinned `brace-expansion` (^2.1.2) and `js-yaml` (^4.3.0) via `package.json` overrides to resolve security vulnerabilities.
- **Documentation Image Dimensions**: Standardized `run-debug.gif` display width to 600px across all documentation pages to match standard GIF ratios.

### 🎨 Changed
- **Marketplace Discovery & Positioning**: Re-aligned `displayName`, `description`, and expanded search keywords in `package.json` to highlight test execution, debugging, step navigation, and linting.
- **High-Conversion README**: Restructured the root `README.md` to clearly highlight core capabilities, target audiences (zero-config vs. Python/Behave), and quick-start steps.

## [1.7.6] - 2026-07-20

### 🚀 Added
- **Shared Project Configuration**: You can now create a `.gherkin-powertoolsrc.json` file in the root of your project. This allows you to enforce team-wide formatting rules, indentation, and step file discovery globs, overriding local VS Code settings. The file includes full schema validation, autocompletion, and hover documentation.
- **Global Dialect Support for Linter (i18n)**: The semantic linter and diagnostics engine is now fully dialect-aware. It dynamically reads your `# language: [code]` header and validates syntax across 70+ languages, including localized Quick-Fix recommendations (e.g., suggesting `Fonctionnalité:` instead of `Feature:`).
- **Context-Aware Fuzzy Matching**: The linter now evaluates structural context before offering typo corrections, eliminating aggressive false-positive diagnostics when normal English prose resembles Gherkin keywords.
- **Live Tag Telemetry**: The tag counter now tracks active unsaved edits instantly, without needing to save the document first.
- **AST-Scoped Range Formatting**: Range formatting (Format Selection) now natively parses the Abstract Syntax Tree to identify the smallest logical node encompassing your selection. Selecting a partial `DataTable`, a multi-line `DocString`, or a block of steps now correctly re-formats the entire structural element atomically, guaranteeing perfect vertical alignment.
- **Configurable Tag Sorting**: Tag wrapping is now fully decoupled from sorting. By default, the formatter will preserve your original tag order (including duplicates). Added `gherkinPowerTools.tags.sort` setting to optionally sort tags alphabetically.
- **Behave Execution CodeLens**: Run and edit features and scenarios directly from the editor using `▶ Run Feature`, `▶ Run Scenario`, `✏️ Edit Feature...`, and `✏️ Edit Scenario...` CodeLens buttons with dedicated terminal execution and custom arguments support.
- **Code Actions (Quick Fixes)**: Intelligent quick fixes for Gherkin syntax errors, including generating undefined Python step stubs, inserting missing colons, and converting Scenarios to Scenario Outlines.
- **Remote Workspace Compatibility**: Feature files are now parsed correctly over virtual filesystems (e.g., GitHub Codespaces, SSH, and remote tunnels) using VS Code's native `workspace.fs` API.
- **Semantic Context-Aware Navigation**: Go To Definition and Hover providers now fully respect strict `Given/When/Then` matching and dynamically resolve `And`/`But` continuations backwards through the scenario.
- **Ambiguous Step Resolution**: If a step matches multiple Python definitions (e.g., overlapping wildcard regular expressions), Go To Definition now opens a Peek View showing all matches instead of arbitrarily jumping to the first one. The Hover provider also enumerates all matching signatures.
- **Safe Hover Docstrings**: Python docstrings rendered in the Hover widget are now strictly displayed as plain untrusted text, preventing accidental markdown injection or rendering glitches.
- **Unsupported Matcher Transparency**: The Hover provider now explicitly warns you if a step definition uses Python-specific regex capabilities (like lookbehinds) that cannot be dynamically evaluated by the extension.
- **Robust Parsing Fallback**: If a feature file contains severe syntax errors, the cache will now gracefully downgrade to a "Partial" state and salvage any parsable scenarios, while displaying an inline warning in the hover widget.


### 🛠️ Changed
- **Architectural Refactor**: Rebuilt the underlying `FeatureCache` to operate asynchronously with a 300ms debounce window and an incremental diffing strategy. This drastically reduces CPU overhead during rapid typing and eliminates full-workspace re-indexing on single-file changes.

## [1.7.5] - 2026-07-18

### 🐛 Fixed
- **Strict Semantic Matching Fix**: Fixed a critical bug in the linter and definition providers where explicit step keywords (e.g., `Given`, `When`, `Then`) were being incorrectly overridden by the context of preceding steps.
  This resolves issues where perfectly valid steps like `Then align` were falsely flagged as "Undefined Step" when the Python step definition used a strictly-matching decorator like `@then`.

## [1.7.4] - 2026-07-18

### 🛠️ Changed
- **Centralized File Discovery**: Introduced `BehaveFileDiscoveryService` to act as the single source of truth for locating Behave step files.
  - **Dynamic Configuration Hot-Reload**: Changes to `gherkinPowerTools.behave.stepGlobs` or `ignoreGlobs` settings are now applied immediately. Live file system watchers are dynamically recreated, cache is re-indexed, and open features are instantly re-linted without requiring a VS Code restart.
  - **Multi-Root Workspace Intelligence**: Step definition generation (Quick Fix) now correctly infers the appropriate base workspace folder if multiple roots are opened.
- **Resilient Regex Compilation (`StepDefinition`)**: The workspace indexer now gracefully handles Python-specific regular expressions (like advanced lookbehinds) that are unsupported by the JavaScript V8 engine.
  Instead of silently discarding these steps, they are preserved in the Symbol Cache and marked as non-evaluable. This ensures they remain visible in global autocompletion and workspace symbols, while being safely excluded from automated text matching (Linting, Go-To-Definition, Hover).
- **Bounded Python Tokenizer**: Replaced the fragile regex-based parser with a bespoke state-machine to extract Python step decorators reliably without requiring a full AST parser.
  - **Dynamic Expression Fallback**: The extension now properly identifies and flags dynamic expressions (e.g. `@given(MY_VAR)`) or concatenated strings, preventing runtime crashes during real-time Linter/Hover validation while still indexing them for "Go-To-Definition".
  - **Robust Literal Parsing**: Accurately tracks multiline triple quotes (`"""`, `'''`), internal escape sequences (`\"`), and complex string prefixes (`r`, `u`, `f`, `b`, `rf`).
- **Semantic Step Matching (`@given`/`@when`/`@then`)**: The extension now respects Behave's strict semantic decorators.
  Linter diagnostics, autocomplete, hover documentation, and Go-To-Definition links correctly disambiguate identical step patterns based on their `Given`, `When`, or `Then` prefix.
  Localized continuation keywords (`And`, `But`) are dynamically resolved backwards through the scenario block.
  Generic `@step` decorators remain wildcard matches.

## [1.7.3] - 2026-07-16

### 🛠️ Changed
- **TypeScript Type-Safety & Parser Architecture Refactor**: Completely centralized the `@cucumber/gherkin` AST parsing logic into a single internal module.
  - **Thread-Safety**: Replaced shared global parser state with fresh deterministic instances per operation, preventing bleed and memory leaks during concurrent linting or formatting.
  - **Strict Type-Safety**: Replaced ambiguous `any` usages across the Linter, Formatter, Statistics, and Outline providers with exact `@cucumber/messages` interface types (`GherkinDocument`, `Feature`, `Scenario`, `Step`, etc.).
  - **Partial AST Fallbacks**: Formalized fallback logic to retrieve and traverse partial AST trees even during severe syntax failures, preserving semantic analysis capabilities.
- **CI/CD Hardening & Cross-Platform E2E**: Refactored all GitHub Actions workflows to adhere to the principle of least privilege, explicitly removing unnecessary write permissions.
  - **Recoverable Releases**: The `release.yml` pipeline is now fully idempotent, capable of securely resuming and fixing a broken release if the VSIX upload fails midway.
  - **Multi-OS UI Testing**: The End-to-End visual test suite now executes natively across `macos-latest`, `windows-latest`, and `ubuntu-latest`.
  - **Native Check Runs**: Switched test reporting from noisy PR comments to silent, native GitHub Check Runs.

### 🚀 Added
- **AST-Based Project Analytics**: The Project Statistics dashboard has been completely refactored to use the official `@cucumber/gherkin` AST parsing engine instead of line-by-line regex scanning.
  - **100% Precision**: Correctly counts features, rules, backgrounds, scenarios, outlines, Example rows, executable steps, tags, and data tables across the entire workspace.
  - **Objective Refinements**: Separated data tables from Example rows for more accurate metrics. Renamed internal marketing labels to engineering standards ("Gherkin Quality Score" -> "Gherkin Quality Indicator", "Most Complex Scenario" -> "Longest scenario", "ROI" -> "Estimated execution effort").
  - **Real-Time Asynchronous Loading**: Uses `vscode.workspace.fs` and `vscode.window.withProgress` to index the workspace asynchronously with full CancellationToken support, ensuring the UI thread remains unblocked even in massive projects.
- **Range Formatting Restored**: Re-implemented the `DocumentRangeFormattingEditProvider` safely. The formatting engine now maps the exact origins of generated output lines (including expanded tags and docstrings), allowing partial text selections to be formatted securely without data drift or corruption.
- **Formatter AST Engine Refactor**: Completely rewrote the Gherkin formatting engine using strict `@cucumber/messages` AST parsing for flawless precision.
  - **Data Integrity**: Reconstructs data tables natively through AST `cell.value` and re-escapes pipes, preventing data corruption on complex markdown cells with `\|`.
  - **Idempotency**: Formatting a perfectly formatted document now returns zero text edits, keeping your Git and Undo stacks clean.
  - **Encoding Preservation**: Dynamically detects and preserves exact `CRLF` or `LF` encodings and final newlines natively.
  - **DocString Perfection**: Properly preserves internal spacing for multi-line blocks like JSON payloads, while shifting the base indentation relatively.
- **Universal Multilingual Support (DialectService)**: Centralized all keyword parsing to use the official `@cucumber/gherkin` dialect database. The extension now natively understands translated keywords (e.g., `Dado`, `Angenommen`, `Soit`) for English, Spanish, French, German, and all other 70+ languages supported by Cucumber.
  - Automatically detects dialect via the `# language: <lang>` header.
  - Syntax Highlighting, Hover, Auto-completion, Code Actions, Go-To Definition, and Formatting seamlessly adapt to the document's locale.
  - Dynamically resolves `And` / `But` continuations in all supported languages by parsing preceding step context.
- **Context-Aware Autocompletion**: The `CompletionProvider` is now context-aware! It strictly filters Python suggestions based on the semantic step keyword typed (e.g., `Given` only suggests `@given` steps) and resolves the root context of `And`/`But` chains. Regex capture groups and Behave placeholders (`{param:d}`) are securely translated into VS Code Snippet tab stops.
- **Asynchronous Non-Blocking Workspace Indexing**: The `SymbolCache` has been completely rewritten using `vscode.workspace.findFiles` to index `.py` steps asynchronously without blocking the UI thread. Added public settings `gherkinPowerTools.behave.stepGlobs` and `gherkinPowerTools.behave.ignoreGlobs` to tune directory coverage securely.

## [1.7.2] - 2026-07-15

### Added
- **Robust Behave Step Generation**: The "Create empty step definition" Quick Fix has been completely overhauled for Python/Behave projects.
  - Safely escapes Gherkin strings containing quotes, backslashes, and emojis (`u'...'`).
  - Generates valid, collision-free Python function names (`def step_impl_1(context)`).
  - Semantically resolves `And` and `But` keywords by scanning upwards to inherit the preceding `@given`, `@when`, or `@then` decorator.
- **Ambiguous Step Linter (`AMBIGUOUS_STEP`)**: Detects and warns users in real-time when a Gherkin step matches multiple overlapping regular expressions (e.g., generic decorators like `@given(r'I am an (.*) step')`) in your Python code, mimicking runtime errors.
- **Scenario Outline Parameter Autocomplete**: Typing `<` inside a step within a `Scenario Outline` will now automatically parse the block and provide an IntelliSense dropdown with the column headers from the underlying `Examples` table. Selecting a parameter automatically appends the closing `>` bracket.


### Fixed
- **Deterministic Cache Initialization**: Fixed a critical race condition during extension startup where files were linted against an empty cache, causing false-positive `UNDEFINED_STEP` errors. Cache initialization is now governed by a strict asynchronous state machine.
- **Stale Asynchronous Diagnostics**: Implemented a per-URI debounce mechanism (250ms) and request tracker for the Linter to eliminate a race condition where rapid typing caused outdated parsing results to overwrite newer diagnostic states.

### Security
- **Webview XSS Hardening**: Secured the Statistics Dashboard against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and HTML injection by disabling JavaScript (`enableScripts: false`), enforcing a strict Content-Security-Policy (`default-src 'none'; style-src 'unsafe-inline'`), replacing animations with pure CSS, and sanitizing all user-provided data via a centralized `escapeHtml` utility.
  Added a dedicated security test suite.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-07-13

### Performance
- **Turbocharged Activation (Esbuild)**: Migrated the build system from standard TypeScript (`tsc`) to **Esbuild**. The extension now bundles all source code and dependencies into a single minified `extension.js` file, slashing the `.vsix` payload size and dropping activation times to a flat 0ms.

### Added
- **Tag Blast Radius Hover**: Hovering over any Gherkin tag (`@tag`) now dynamically calculates and displays the total number of scenarios affected by that tag across the entire workspace, taking into account `Feature`/`Rule` tag inheritance and multiplying by `Scenario Outline` data rows.
- **Gherkin PowerTools Output Channel**: Added a native VS Code Output Channel for transparent logging. Users can now monitor cache indexing progress, parser fallback events, and trace syntax errors without needing Developer Tools.
- **Enterprise-Grade Testing**: Drastically expanded the testing architecture to achieve a **92.7% Code Coverage**.
  - Expanded unit tests to strictly cover edge cases in AST Fallbacks, Code Actions, and Symbol Caching.
  - Implemented 8 comprehensive Headless E2E scenarios via `@vscode/test-electron` covering real UI interactions (Hover, Definition, Quick Fixes, Autocomplete).

### Security
- **Strict Webview CSP**: Hardened the Statistics Dashboard Webview by implementing a strict Content Security Policy (`<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy">`), preventing inline script execution and complying with top-tier VS Code security standards.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-07-10

### Features
- **Hover Provider (Documentation Preview)**:
  - Displays the Python function signature and docstring in a rich tooltip when hovering over a Gherkin step.
  - The Autocomplete suggestion details panel now correctly injects the exact raw Pattern/Regex and the Source file path where the definition is located.
  - Automatically parses multiline function definitions and docstrings in Python to provide accurate context without switching files.
- **Smart Autocompletion Provider (IntelliSense)**:
  - Dynamically extracts string patterns from Python step definitions (`@given`, `@when`, etc.).
  - Instantly offers intelligent auto-complete suggestions the moment a user types a keyword.
  - Automatically transforms `Behave` parameters (`{var}`) and regex groups into VS Code interactive Snippet variables (`${1:var}`) for fast tabbing.
  - Smoothly overwrites typed text after the keyword instead of duplicating.

### Added
- **Symbol Cache**: Dramatically improved the performance of the "Go To Definition" feature in large projects. The extension now builds an in-memory index of all Python step definitions upon activation and dynamically updates it when files are modified, reducing lookup times to 0 milliseconds and eliminating continuous disk I/O.
- **Code Actions (Quick Fixes)**: The extension now provides VS Code Quick Fixes for Gherkin files.
  - **Undefined Steps**: Integrates with the Symbol Cache. If a step is not found in Python, a Quick Fix lets you automatically generate an empty Python step definition in your `steps/` directory.
  - **Syntax Error Auto-Corrections**: If you miss a colon on a block keyword (`Feature`, `Scenario`) or misspell a step keyword (`Givn`), Quick Fixes will offer to instantly auto-correct them.
  - **Structure Auto-Corrections**: If you add `Examples:` under a standard `Scenario`, a Quick Fix will offer to convert it to a `Scenario Outline`.
  - **Table Auto-Corrections**: If you forget to close a data table row with a pipe (`|`), a Quick Fix will offer to append it for you.
- **Fault-Tolerant Linter Engine**:
  - **Syntax Crash Resilience**: The Linter now employs a multi-pass hybrid parsing strategy. If severe syntax errors (like typos) crash the official AST parser, the Linter seamlessly falls back to a custom text-based scanner to continue providing structural diagnostics (like detecting `Examples` inside a standard `Scenario`).
  - **Precise Error Mapping**: Solved an issue where the AST parser would strip empty lines from description blocks, causing diagnostics (like missing colons) to point to the wrong lines. The extension now uses dynamic text-mapping to anchor errors to their exact physical line in your document.

### Security
- **Dependency Override**: Forced `serialize-javascript` to version `^7.0.5` via npm `overrides` to mitigate a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability (CVE-2020-7660 incomplete fix) caused by unescaped RegExp flags and Date properties. This secures the test framework (`mocha`) without requiring a major framework downgrade.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added — AST Parsing Engine (Core)
- **Mathematical Precision**: Replaced the legacy Regex-based parser with the official `@cucumber/gherkin` Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser. This brings flawless, mathematical precision to code analysis.
- **Bulletproof Formatting**: Formatting rules now correctly ignore keywords embedded inside `"""` DocStrings, `|` Data Tables, and `#` Comments, preventing catastrophic layout breakages on complex files.
- **Diagnostics Reliability**: The Live Linter now uses the AST to surface syntax errors (like missing colons or invalid tokens) in real-time with 100% accuracy.

### Added — Omega Squeeze (Project Analytics V6)
- **Project Analytics**: Completely redesigned the `Gherkin: Show Project Statistics` dashboard with a premium glassmorphism interface and animated dynamic numbers.
- **Code Actions (Quick Fixes)**: The extension now provides VS Code Quick Fixes for Gherkin files.

  - **Syntax Error Auto-Corrections**: If you miss a colon on a block keyword (`Feature`, `Scenario`) or misspell a step keyword (`Givn`), Quick Fixes will offer to instantly auto-correct them.
  - **Structure Auto-Corrections**: If you add `Examples:` under a standard `Scenario`, a Quick Fix will offer to convert it to a `Scenario Outline`.
  - **Table Auto-Corrections**: If you forget to close a data table row with a pipe (`|`), a Quick Fix will offer to append it for you.
- **Gherkin Quality Score (GQS)**: Added a proprietary algorithm to evaluate code quality based on Reusability (Backgrounds), Parametrization (Examples), Documentation (Comments), and Complexity (Avg Steps per Scenario).
- **Automation ROI Tracking**: Added a new metric to calculate the estimated manual hours saved by your automated tests, using the exact number of executable permutations.
- **Tags Intelligence**: Added in-memory tracking of all tags to display a "Top 5 Most Used Tags" leaderboard.

### Added — Documentation Site (MkDocs Material)
- **`mkdocs.yml`**: Full MkDocs Material configuration with deep purple theme, dark/light mode, search, code copy, and Mermaid diagrams.
- **14 documentation pages**: Home, Installation, Configuration, 7 feature pages (Formatter, Linter, Go To Definition, Outline, Statistics, Highlighting, Snippets), Architecture (with Mermaid diagrams), Contributing, Code of Conduct, Security, and Changelog.
- Documentation will be deployed to `https://carlos-camara.github.io/vscode-gherkin-powertools/`.

### Changed
- **`src/formatter.ts`**: Prefixed unused parameters with underscore (`_options`, `_token`) to suppress TypeScript lint warnings.
- **`src/highlighter.ts`**: Replaced raw hex colors with professional VS Code native palette (`#C586C0`, `#569CD6`, `#4EC9B0`).
- **`src/definition.ts`**: Removed unused `path` import.

- **Documentation (`docs/`)**: Upgraded all markdown pages to use MkDocs Admonitions (`!!! tip`) and visual emojis.
- **Packaging**: Highly optimized `.vscodeignore` to exclude heavy `docs/` and `assets/` folders, dropping the `.vsix` payload size from 18 MB to 408 KB while maintaining functional URLs in the Marketplace.
- **Testing**: Upgraded integration tests to run on Node 22 via `@vscode/test-electron@3.0.0`.
- **Internal / CI**:
  - Migrated tests from custom programmatic Mocha runner to the official `@vscode/test-cli`.
  - Removed `nyc` in favor of built-in `c8` V8 coverage reporting.
  - Migrated code coverage reporting in Pull Requests to a reusable GitHub Action from the `qa-hub-actions` repository (replacing the local bash script to maximize modularity).

### Fixed
- **Packaging**: Removed `node_modules/**` from `.vscodeignore` so the AST parser runtime dependencies are correctly bundled in the VSIX.
- **Go To Definition**: Fixed greedy Regex matching that consumed entire lines in Behave steps.
- **Go To Definition**: Added support for Python string literal prefixes (`r`, `u`, `f`, `b`) in `@given`, `@when`, `@then` decorators.
- **Go To Definition**: Fixed escaping of `*` in the Regex generator to prevent ReDoS and matching failures.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-25
### Added
- **Multi-language Support (i18n)**: Formatter now fully supports formatting and indenting for English, Spanish, French, and German Gherkin keywords.
- **Diagnostic Provider (Linter)**: Hardened the linter rules to strictly enforce colons (`:`) on block keywords and spaces on step keywords, immediately flagging syntax errors.
- **Cascading Indentation**: The formatter now uses a beautiful cascading (stair-step) indentation style by default: 2 spaces for `Scenario`, 3 for `Given/When/Then`, and 4 for `And/But`.
- **Inline Comment Alignment**: Formatter now dynamically aligns inline comments (`#`) to the same vertical column for perfect visual readability.
- **Outline Provider**: Added an interactive tree view in the VS Code "Outline" panel for quick navigation between `Feature`, `Rule`, and `Scenario` blocks.
- **Context Menu Command**: Added a "Format Gherkin Document" action to the editor's right-click context menu.
- **Snippets**: Bundled comprehensive autocompletion snippets for common Gherkin blocks (`feature`, `scenario`, `outline`, `rule`).
- **Configuration `gherkinPowerTools.tags.format`**: Added option to format tags either as `wrap` (80 chars max line length) or `singleLine`.
- **Configuration `gherkinPowerTools.emptyLines.betweenScenarios`**: Added setting to customize the exact number of blank lines to enforce between major blocks.
- **Go to Definition (Python/Behave)**: You can now `Cmd + Click` (or `F12`) on any Gherkin step (e.g. `Given I login`) and VS Code will automatically search your `steps/` folder and jump directly to the Python `.py` file where that `@given` or `@step` decorator is defined.
- **Project Statistics Dashboard**: Added a new command (`Gherkin: Show Project Statistics`) that scans your workspace and displays a beautiful HTML dashboard with metrics on your Features, Rules, and Scenarios. This is also accessible by Right-Clicking inside the editor.
- **Beautiful Syntax Highlighting**: Overrides default VS Code themes to dynamically colorize Gherkin files. Features a stunning **Magenta** for structural keywords (`Feature`, `Scenario`, `Rule`) and **Blue** for action steps (`Given`, `When`, `Then`).
- **Real-time Diagnostic Linter**: Includes a built-in Linter that monitors your feature files as you type. If you mistype a keyword or use invalid syntax, the editor will immediately underline it in red and provide an explanation.
- **Built-in Snippets**: Includes standard autocompletion snippets. Type `feature`, `scenario`, `outline`, or `rule` inside a blank document and press `Tab` to instantly scaffold properly formatted templates.

### Changed
- Refactored internal formatting engine to use dynamic Regex mapping for multi-language support.
- Excluded development dependencies and test artifacts (`.vscode-test`, `node_modules`) from the VSIX package via `.vscodeignore`.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-24
### Added

- **Tag Sorting & Formatting**: Sorts tags alphabetically (e.g., `@smoke @api` -> `@api @smoke`) and formats them based on user configuration. By default, it wraps tags if they exceed 80 characters, but this can be configured to remain on a single line.
