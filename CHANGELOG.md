🔗 **[Read the full release notes on GitHub](https://github.com/carlos-camara/vscode-gherkin-powertools/releases)**

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### 🛠️ Changed
- **Centralized File Discovery**: Introduced `BehaveFileDiscoveryService` to act as the single source of truth for locating Behave step files.
  - **Dynamic Configuration Hot-Reload**: Changes to `gherkinPowerTools.behave.stepGlobs` or `ignoreGlobs` settings are now applied immediately. Live file system watchers are dynamically recreated, cache is re-indexed, and open features are instantly re-linted without requiring a VS Code restart.
  - **Multi-Root Workspace Intelligence**: Step definition generation (Quick Fix) now correctly infers the appropriate base workspace folder if multiple roots are opened.

## [1.7.3] - 2026-07-16

### 🛠️ Changed
- **TypeScript Type-Safety & Parser Architecture Refactor**: Completely centralized the `@cucumber/gherkin` AST parsing logic into a single internal module.
  - **Thread-Safety**: Replaced shared global parser state with fresh deterministic instances per operation, preventing bleed and memory leaks during concurrent linting or formatting.
  - **Strict Type-Safety**: Replaced ambiguous `any` usages across the Linter, Formatter, Statistics, and Outline providers with exact `@cucumber/messages` interface types (`GherkinDocument`, `Feature`, `Scenario`, `Step`, etc.).
  - **Partial AST Fallbacks**: Formalized fallback logic to retrieve and traverse partial AST trees even during severe syntax failures, preserving semantic analysis capabilities.
- **CI/CD Hardening & Cross-Platform E2E**: Refactored all GitHub Actions workflows to adhere to the principle of least privilege, explicitly removing unnecessary write permissions.
  - **Recoverable Releases**: The `release.yml` pipeline is now fully idempotent, capable of securely resuming and fixing a broken release if the VSIX upload fails midway.
  - **Multi-OS UI Testing**: The End-to-End visual test suite now executes natively across `macos-latest`, `windows-latest`, and `ubuntu-latest`.
  - **Native Check Runs**: Switched test reporting from noisy PR comments to silent, native GitHub Check Runs.

### 🚀 Added
- **AST-Based Project Analytics**: The Project Statistics dashboard has been completely refactored to use the official `@cucumber/gherkin` AST parsing engine instead of line-by-line regex scanning.
  - **100% Precision**: Correctly counts features, rules, backgrounds, scenarios, outlines, Example rows, executable steps, tags, and data tables across the entire workspace.
  - **Objective Refinements**: Separated data tables from Example rows for more accurate metrics. Renamed internal marketing labels to engineering standards ("Gherkin Quality Score" -> "Gherkin Quality Indicator", "Most Complex Scenario" -> "Longest scenario", "ROI" -> "Estimated execution effort").
  - **Real-Time Asynchronous Loading**: Uses `vscode.workspace.fs` and `vscode.window.withProgress` to index the workspace asynchronously with full CancellationToken support, ensuring the UI thread remains unblocked even in massive projects.
- **Range Formatting Restored**: Re-implemented the `DocumentRangeFormattingEditProvider` safely. The formatting engine now maps the exact origins of generated output lines (including expanded tags and docstrings), allowing partial text selections to be formatted securely without data drift or corruption.
- **Formatter AST Engine Refactor**: Completely rewrote the Gherkin formatting engine using strict `@cucumber/messages` AST parsing for flawless precision.
  - **Data Integrity**: Reconstructs data tables natively through AST `cell.value` and re-escapes pipes, preventing data corruption on complex markdown cells with `\|`.
  - **Idempotency**: Formatting a perfectly formatted document now returns zero text edits, keeping your Git and Undo stacks clean.
  - **Encoding Preservation**: Dynamically detects and preserves exact `CRLF` or `LF` encodings and final newlines natively.
  - **DocString Perfection**: Properly preserves internal spacing for multi-line blocks like JSON payloads, while shifting the base indentation relatively.
- **Universal Multilingual Support (DialectService)**: Centralized all keyword parsing to use the official `@cucumber/gherkin` dialect database. The extension now natively understands translated keywords (e.g., `Dado`, `Angenommen`, `Soit`) for English, Spanish, French, German, and all other 70+ languages supported by Cucumber.
  - Automatically detects dialect via the `# language: <lang>` header.
  - Syntax Highlighting, Hover, Auto-completion, Code Actions, Go-To Definition, and Formatting seamlessly adapt to the document's locale.
  - Dynamically resolves `And` / `But` continuations in all supported languages by parsing preceding step context.
- **Context-Aware Autocompletion**: The `CompletionProvider` is now context-aware! It strictly filters Python suggestions based on the semantic step keyword typed (e.g., `Given` only suggests `@given` steps) and resolves the root context of `And`/`But` chains. Regex capture groups and Behave placeholders (`{param:d}`) are securely translated into VS Code Snippet tab stops.
- **Asynchronous Non-Blocking Workspace Indexing**: The `SymbolCache` has been completely rewritten using `vscode.workspace.findFiles` to index `.py` steps asynchronously without blocking the UI thread. Added public settings `gherkinPowerTools.behave.stepGlobs` and `gherkinPowerTools.behave.ignoreGlobs` to tune directory coverage securely.

## [1.7.2] - 2026-07-15

### Added
- **Robust Behave Step Generation**: The "Create empty step definition" Quick Fix has been completely overhauled for Python/Behave projects.
  - Safely escapes Gherkin strings containing quotes, backslashes, and emojis (`u'...'`).
  - Generates valid, collision-free Python function names (`def step_impl_1(context)`).
  - Semantically resolves `And` and `But` keywords by scanning upwards to inherit the preceding `@given`, `@when`, or `@then` decorator.
- **Ambiguous Step Linter (`AMBIGUOUS_STEP`)**: Detects and warns users in real-time when a Gherkin step matches multiple overlapping regular expressions (e.g., generic decorators like `@given(r'I am an (.*) step')`) in your Python code, mimicking runtime errors.
- **Scenario Outline Parameter Autocomplete**: Typing `<` inside a step within a `Scenario Outline` will now automatically parse the block and provide an IntelliSense dropdown with the column headers from the underlying `Examples` table. Selecting a parameter automatically appends the closing `>` bracket.


### Fixed
- **Deterministic Cache Initialization**: Fixed a critical race condition during extension startup where files were linted against an empty cache, causing false-positive `UNDEFINED_STEP` errors. Cache initialization is now governed by a strict asynchronous state machine.
- **Stale Asynchronous Diagnostics**: Implemented a per-URI debounce mechanism (250ms) and request tracker for the Linter to eliminate a race condition where rapid typing caused outdated parsing results to overwrite newer diagnostic states.

### Security
- **Webview XSS Hardening**: Secured the Statistics Dashboard against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and HTML injection by disabling JavaScript (`enableScripts: false`), enforcing a strict Content-Security-Policy (`default-src 'none'; style-src 'unsafe-inline'`), replacing animations with pure CSS, and sanitizing all user-provided data via a centralized `escapeHtml` utility.
  Added a dedicated security test suite.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-07-13

### Performance
- **Turbocharged Activation (Esbuild)**: Migrated the build system from standard TypeScript (`tsc`) to **Esbuild**. The extension now bundles all source code and dependencies into a single minified `extension.js` file, slashing the `.vsix` payload size and dropping activation times to a flat 0ms.

### Added
- **Tag Blast Radius Hover**: Hovering over any Gherkin tag (`@tag`) now dynamically calculates and displays the total number of scenarios affected by that tag across the entire workspace, taking into account `Feature`/`Rule` tag inheritance and multiplying by `Scenario Outline` data rows.
- **Gherkin PowerTools Output Channel**: Added a native VS Code Output Channel for transparent logging. Users can now monitor cache indexing progress, parser fallback events, and trace syntax errors without needing Developer Tools.
- **Enterprise-Grade Testing**: Drastically expanded the testing architecture to achieve a **92.7% Code Coverage**.
  - Expanded unit tests to strictly cover edge cases in AST Fallbacks, Code Actions, and Symbol Caching.
  - Implemented 8 comprehensive Headless E2E scenarios via `@vscode/test-electron` covering real UI interactions (Hover, Definition, Quick Fixes, Autocomplete).

### Security
- **Strict Webview CSP**: Hardened the Statistics Dashboard Webview by implementing a strict Content Security Policy (`<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy">`), preventing inline script execution and complying with top-tier VS Code security standards.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-07-10

### Features
- **Hover Provider (Documentation Preview)**:
  - Displays the Python function signature and docstring in a rich tooltip when hovering over a Gherkin step.
  - Automatically parses multiline function definitions and docstrings in Python to provide accurate context without switching files.
- **Smart Autocompletion Provider (IntelliSense)**:
  - Dynamically extracts string patterns from Python step definitions (`@given`, `@when`, etc.).
  - Instantly offers intelligent auto-complete suggestions the moment a user types a keyword.
  - Automatically transforms `Behave` parameters (`{var}`) and regex groups into VS Code interactive Snippet variables (`${1:var}`) for fast tabbing.
  - Smoothly overwrites typed text after the keyword instead of duplicating.

### Added
- **Symbol Cache**: Dramatically improved the performance of the "Go To Definition" feature in large projects. The extension now builds an in-memory index of all Python step definitions upon activation and dynamically updates it when files are modified, reducing lookup times to 0 milliseconds and eliminating continuous disk I/O.
- **Code Actions (Quick Fixes)**: The extension now provides VS Code Quick Fixes for Gherkin files.
  - **Undefined Steps**: Integrates with the Symbol Cache. If a step is not found in Python, a Quick Fix lets you automatically generate an empty Python step definition in your `steps/` directory.
  - **Syntax Error Auto-Corrections**: If you miss a colon on a block keyword (`Feature`, `Scenario`) or misspell a step keyword (`Givn`), Quick Fixes will offer to instantly auto-correct them.
  - **Structure Auto-Corrections**: If you add `Examples:` under a standard `Scenario`, a Quick Fix will offer to convert it to a `Scenario Outline`.
  - **Table Auto-Corrections**: If you forget to close a data table row with a pipe (`|`), a Quick Fix will offer to append it for you.
- **Fault-Tolerant Linter Engine**:
  - **Syntax Crash Resilience**: The Linter now employs a multi-pass hybrid parsing strategy. If severe syntax errors (like typos) crash the official AST parser, the Linter seamlessly falls back to a custom text-based scanner to continue providing structural diagnostics (like detecting `Examples` inside a standard `Scenario`).
  - **Precise Error Mapping**: Solved an issue where the AST parser would strip empty lines from description blocks, causing diagnostics (like missing colons) to point to the wrong lines. The extension now uses dynamic text-mapping to anchor errors to their exact physical line in your document.

### Security
- **Dependency Override**: Forced `serialize-javascript` to version `^7.0.5` via npm `overrides` to mitigate a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability (CVE-2020-7660 incomplete fix) caused by unescaped RegExp flags and Date properties. This secures the test framework (`mocha`) without requiring a major framework downgrade.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added — AST Parsing Engine (Core)
- **Mathematical Precision**: Replaced the legacy Regex-based parser with the official `@cucumber/gherkin` Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser. This brings flawless, mathematical precision to code analysis.
- **Bulletproof Formatting**: Formatting rules now correctly ignore keywords embedded inside `"""` DocStrings, `|` Data Tables, and `#` Comments, preventing catastrophic layout breakages on complex files.

- **Go To Definition**: Fixed greedy Regex matching that consumed entire lines in Behave steps.
- **Go To Definition**: Added support for Python string literal prefixes (`r`, `u`, `f`, `b`) in `@given`, `@when`, `@then` decorators.
- **Go To Definition**: Fixed escaping of `*` in the Regex generator to prevent ReDoS and matching failures.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-25
### Added
- **Multi-language Support (i18n)**: Formatter now fully supports formatting, indenting, and Auto-Casing for English, Spanish, French, and German Gherkin keywords.
- **Diagnostic Provider (Linter)**: Hardened the linter rules to strictly enforce colons (`:`) on block keywords and spaces on step keywords, immediately flagging syntax errors.
- **Cascading Indentation**: The formatter now uses a beautiful cascading (stair-step) indentation style by default: 2 spaces for `Scenario`, 3 for `Given/When/Then`, and 4 for `And/But`.
- **Inline Comment Alignment**: Formatter now dynamically aligns inline comments (`#`) to the same vertical column for perfect visual readability.
- **Outline Provider**: Added an interactive tree view in the VS Code "Outline" panel for quick navigation between `Feature`, `Rule`, and `Scenario` blocks.
- **Context Menu Command**: Added a "Format Gherkin Document" action to the editor's right-click context menu.
- **Snippets**: Bundled comprehensive autocompletion snippets for common Gherkin blocks (`feature`, `scenario`, `outline`, `rule`).
- **Configuration `gherkinPowerTools.tags.format`**: Added option to format tags either as `wrap` (80 chars max line length) or `singleLine`.
- **Configuration `gherkinPowerTools.emptyLines.betweenScenarios`**: Added setting to customize the exact number of blank lines to enforce between major blocks.
- **Go to Definition (Python/Behave)**: You can now `Cmd + Click` (or `F12`) on any Gherkin step (e.g. `Given I login`) and VS Code will automatically search your `steps/` folder and jump directly to the Python `.py` file where that `@given` or `@step` decorator is defined.
- **Project Statistics Dashboard**: Added a new command (`Gherkin: Show Project Statistics`) that scans your workspace and displays a beautiful HTML dashboard with metrics on your Features, Rules, and Scenarios. This is also accessible by Right-Clicking inside the editor.
- **Beautiful Syntax Highlighting**: Overrides default VS Code themes to dynamically colorize Gherkin files. Features a stunning **Magenta** for structural keywords (`Feature`, `Scenario`, `Rule`) and **Blue** for action steps (`Given`, `When`, `Then`).
- **Real-time Diagnostic Linter**: Includes a built-in Linter that monitors your feature files as you type. If you mistype a keyword or use invalid syntax, the editor will immediately underline it in red and provide an explanation.
- **Built-in Snippets**: Includes standard autocompletion snippets. Type `feature`, `scenario`, `outline`, or `rule` inside a blank document and press `Tab` to instantly scaffold properly formatted templates.

### Changed
- Refactored internal formatting engine to use dynamic Regex mapping for multi-language support.
- Excluded development dependencies and test artifacts (`.vscode-test`, `node_modules`) from the VSIX package via `.vscodeignore`.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-24
### Added
- **Auto-Casing**: Formatter now automatically PascalCases Gherkin keywords (`Given`, `When`, `Then`, `Feature`, etc.) regardless of user input.
- **Tag Sorting & Formatting**: Sorts tags alphabetically (e.g., `@smoke @api` -> `@api @smoke`) and formats them based on user configuration. By default, it wraps tags if they exceed 80 characters, but this can be configured to remain on a single line.
- **Whitespace Cleanup**: Automatically collapses consecutive empty lines into a standardized format and trims all trailing whitespace, preventing dirty git commits.
- **Inline Comment Alignment**: Dynamically aligns inline comments (`#`) to the same vertical column within the same code block, creating a beautiful and consistent reading experience.
- **Variable Normalization**: Automatically trims useless spaces inside `Scenario Outline` variables (e.g. `< user name >` becomes `<user name>`) to prevent runner failures.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-24
### Added
- **Configuration Settings**: Added support for customizing the formatter via `settings.json`.
  - `gherkinPowerTools.indentation.steps`: Allows changing step indentation (e.g. from 4 to 2 spaces).
  - `gherkinPowerTools.tables.alignToKeyword`: Allows toggling the dynamic table alignment behavior.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-24
### Added
- **Format Selection Support**: Implemented `DocumentRangeFormattingEditProvider`. Now you can highlight a specific block of text (like a single table) and format only that section without touching the rest of the file using `Cmd+K Cmd+F` (`Ctrl+K Ctrl+F`).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-24
### Added
- **Smart Block Spacing**: Automatically ensures exactly one blank line before major blocks (Scenarios, Rules, Backgrounds, Tags).
- **Dynamic Table Alignment**: Tables now automatically inherit the exact indentation level of their preceding keyword.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-24
### Added
- Initial release.
- Core Gherkin indentation formatting engine.
- Intelligent data table alignment algorithm.
- Integration with VS Code `DocumentFormattingEditProvider`.
