# Diagnostics & Quick Fixes

Gherkin PowerTools features two sophisticated engines to ensure your Behavior-Driven Development suites are robust, maintainable, and syntactically correct: the **Real-Time AST Linter** and the **BDD Anti-Pattern Detection Engine**.

---

## 1. Real-Time AST Linter

The real-time AST linter parses your `.feature` files as you type. It immediately flags structural errors and resolves step definitions across your workspace.

### Instant Diagnostics
- **Syntax Errors (`syntax-error`)**: The document contains invalid Gherkin syntax that prevents parsing.
- **Undefined Steps (`undefined-step`)**: No matching Python step definition was found.
- **Ambiguous Steps (`ambiguous-step`)**: Multiple Python step definitions match the step.
- **Missing Colon (`missing-colon`)**: A required trailing colon is missing after a keyword (e.g. Feature, Scenario).
- **Invalid Keyword (`invalid-keyword`)**: The keyword used is not valid for the current Gherkin dialect (short words require an exact match to prevent false positives).
- **Table Inconsistency (`table-inconsistency`)**: Rows in a Data Table or Examples block have an inconsistent number of cells.
- **Scenario with Examples (`scenario-with-examples`)**: A "Scenario" keyword is used instead of "Scenario Outline" when Examples are present.

### Quick Fixes (Code Actions)
When the linter detects issues, a lightbulb icon (💡) appears, offering instantaneous Quick Fixes (accessible via <kbd>Ctrl+.</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd+.</kbd>):
- **Add Missing Colon**: Fixes structural mistakes like missing colons on `Feature` or `Scenario`.
- **Change Keyword**: Corrects misspelled keywords to a valid one for your dialect. It safely detects structural misuses of `Examples` or `Scenarios` aliases and strictly converts them back to valid `Scenario` keywords to enforce BDD best practices.
- **Convert to Scenario Outline**: Automatically changes a `Scenario` to a `Scenario Outline` if a Data Table uses `<var>` template parameters.
- **Generate Python Step**: For `undefined-step` errors, instantly generates a valid Python stub with extracted parameters.
- **Fix Table Inconsistency**: Adds empty cells or removes overflowing cells to align the table width.

#### Batch Quick Fixes
Run the **Gherkin PowerTools: Fix All Safe Auto-Fixable Problems** command to automatically correct all non-overlapping, deterministic (semantics-preserving) Quick Fixes across the entire active document without breaking undo history. Alternatively, run **Gherkin PowerTools: Fix All Auto** to apply all safe formatting and fixes.

## 2. BDD Anti-Pattern Detection Engine

The Anti-Pattern Engine runs on a 500ms debounce to conserve system resources. It analyzes your entire test suite layout (features, scenarios, and Python implementations) to identify architectural and maintainability issues.

### Heuristic Rules

These rules evaluate the design of your test suite. Their severity and thresholds are fully configurable in `gherkinPowerTools.rules`.

- **Oversized Scenario (`oversized-scenario`)**: The Scenario has too many steps, suggesting it is testing too much.
- **Oversized Feature (`oversized-feature`)**: The Feature file has too many Scenarios, making it hard to maintain.
- **Ambiguous Step Definition (`ambiguous-step-definition`)**: A Python step definition pattern overlaps with other definitions, causing ambiguity during execution.
- **Duplicated Steps (`duplicated-steps`)**: The exact same steps are repeated multiple times.
- **Unused Steps (`unused-steps`)**: Python step definitions exist but are not used anywhere. The engine uses a robust `uri:line` deterministic identity within the WorkspaceGraph to guarantee 100% accuracy in blast-radius analysis, preventing false "Unused" positives for steps with identical regex patterns.
- **Excessive Tags (`excessive-tags`)**: Too many tags are applied to a single element.
- **Inconsistent Formatting (`inconsistent-formatting`)**: The Gherkin document contains inconsistent formatting.

## Configuring Rules

You can customize the severity of every rule (except `syntax-error`, which is always an error) across both the Linter and the Anti-Pattern Engine.

Configure `gherkinPowerTools.rules` in your workspace settings or your `.gherkin-powertoolsrc.json` team configuration.

```json
"gherkinPowerTools.rules": {
    "undefined-step": "error",
    "ambiguous-step": "warning",
    "oversized-scenario": {
        "severity": "warning",
        "maxSteps": 15
    },
    "unused-steps": "info"
}
```

**Allowed Severities:**
- `"error"`: Red squiggle (fails CLI checks).
- `"warning"`: Yellow squiggle.
- `"info"`: Blue squiggle.
- `"hint"`: Three faded dots under the text.
- `"off"`: Completely disables the rule.

## Suppressing Findings

If a heuristic anti-pattern finding is deliberate or unavoidable (e.g., a massive legacy scenario you cannot break apart right now), you can suppress it.

1. Place your cursor on the rule violation in your editor.
2. Open the Quick Fix menu (<kbd>Cmd+.</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl+.</kbd>) and select **Suppress finding**.
3. You will be prompted to provide a mandatory **reason** (e.g. "Approved legacy component").
4. The suppression is recorded in a structural ledger at the root of your workspace (`.gherkin-pt-suppressions.json`).

> [!TIP]
> **Multi-root and Cross-Platform Support**
> The suppression engine is fully multi-root workspace aware. Suppressions are stored locally relative to each workspace folder. The engine automatically canonicalizes paths, safely ignoring casing differences on macOS and Windows, ensuring that your suppressions reliably silence diagnostics regardless of how your operating system passes paths to VS Code.

The diagnostic is immediately removed from the editor. Note that core parsing errors like `syntax-error` cannot be suppressed.
