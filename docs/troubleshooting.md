# Troubleshooting

This guide addresses common problems organized by observable symptoms.

---

## First-Run Onboarding did not appear
**Symptom:** You installed the extension but you never saw the welcome notification for Python Behave projects.
**Likely Causes:** The workspace doesn't have any `.feature` files, it isn't recognized as a Python Behave project, or you dismissed the notification previously.
**Diagnostic Steps:** Ensure you have `.feature` files in your workspace.
**Resolution:** Run **Gherkin PowerTools: Replay Onboarding** from the Command Palette to reset the state and manually trigger the detection process.

## Background Initialization Failures
**Symptom:** Features like Go to Definition or IntelliSense are intermittently unavailable right after opening a large workspace, and the extension output logs indicate capability initialization errors.
**Likely Causes:** I/O errors or heavy load caused the Symbol Cache or Workspace Graph to fail their initial startup.
**Diagnostic Steps:** Check the extension Output Panel. Look for logs showing a capability state as `failed`.
**Resolution:** The extension handles this automatically. The internal `DeferredBootstrap` supervisor detects initialization rejections and automatically schedules exponential backoff retries. Simply wait a few moments; the capability will typically recover on the next retry, and dependent capabilities (like the Workspace Graph) will safely re-initialize once the baseline caches are ready.

## Formatting does not run or `.feature` file is not detected
**Symptom:** You press <kbd>Shift+Alt+F</kbd> and nothing happens, or the extension doesn't seem to activate.
**Likely Causes:** The file is not recognized as a Gherkin document, or the formatter is disabled.
**Diagnostic Steps:**
1. Check the bottom right corner of VS Code. Does the language mode say "Feature"? If not, click it and select "Feature".
2. Check your settings for `"gherkinPowerTools.formatter.enabled": false`.
**Resolution:** Ensure the file extension is `.feature`. Remove the disabling setting.

## Diagnostics do not appear
**Symptom:** You type invalid Gherkin, but no red or yellow squiggly lines appear in the editor.
**Likely Causes:** The real-time linter has been disabled in the settings.
**Diagnostic Steps:** Check your settings for `"gherkinPowerTools.linter.enabled": false`. When disabled, the linter enters a completely dormant state to conserve system resources.
**Resolution:** Remove the setting or set `"gherkinPowerTools.linter.enabled": true`.

## Format on Save does not work on some files
**Symptom:** You have Format on Save enabled, but the file doesn't format when saving. However, manually formatting it shows a warning.
**Likely Causes:** The Gherkin file contains structural syntax errors.
**Resolution:** Automatic formatting (like Format on Save) is intentionally designed to be **silent** when syntax errors are present. This prevents intrusive warning popups from interrupting you while you type an incomplete document. Fix the syntax errors (indicated by the red squiggly lines) and the formatter will resume working automatically.

## Autocomplete suggestions are not sorted by popularity
**Symptom:** You use a step frequently, but it does not appear at the very top of the IntelliSense list.
**Likely Causes:** Gherkin PowerTools intentionally overrides raw popularity in favor of semantic relevance.
**Resolution:** The extension uses a strict **5-tier Lexicographical Ranking model**. Exact text matches (Tier 1) and semantic keyword matches (Tier 2 - e.g. `Given` vs `When`) will strictly outrank steps that you simply use more often (Tier 5). This guarantees that autocomplete suggests the technically correct step over a popular but semantically incorrect one.
**Developer Tip:** Enable `gherkinPowerTools.diagnostics.metricsEnabled` and run **Gherkin PowerTools: Explain Completion Ranking** to see exactly why a step was ranked higher.

## Autocomplete stops working for Scenario Outline Parameters
**Symptom:** You type `<` inside a Scenario Outline step, but the autocomplete suggestions for parameters (column headers) do not appear or are outdated.
**Likely Causes:** Your `.feature` file contains severe structural syntax errors that completely break the AST parser around the `Examples` table, and the temporary text-scanning fallback cannot safely determine the local table context.
**Diagnostic Steps:** Check for red error squiggles above or near the current scenario indicating a broken table or missing structural keyword.
**Resolution:** Ensure your `Examples:` table has a valid structure with at least a header row (e.g. `| param1 | param2 |`). Once the syntax error is fixed, the AST parser will instantly recover and precise parameter completion will resume.

## Python steps are not found (Go to Definition / Autocomplete fail)
**Symptom:** You use Python Behave, but steps show as "Undefined" in the Linter, and Go to Definition does not work.
**Likely Causes:** The extension is looking in the wrong directory, or your virtual environment is causing performance timeouts.
**Diagnostic Steps:**
1. Run **Gherkin PowerTools: Diagnose Workspace** from the Command Palette. Check the "Discovered Steps" count.
2. Verify where your Python steps actually live.
**Resolution:**
Update your settings to include your custom path:
```json
"gherkinPowerTools.behave.stepGlobs": [
    "**/my_custom_folder/steps/**/*.py"
]
```
Virtual environments (`.venv`, `env`, `node_modules`, etc.) are automatically excluded by default via **Zero-Config Virtual Environment Discovery** to prevent performance timeouts. If you use a non-standard virtual environment name, ensure it is added to `ignoreGlobs`.

## Ambiguous steps are reported unexpectedly
**Symptom:** The linter flags a step as "Ambiguous" even though Behave runs it fine.
**Likely Causes:** You have multiple regular expressions in your Python decorators that match the exact same string (e.g., overlapping wildcards like `(.*)`).
**Resolution:** Tighten your regular expressions in Python to be mutually exclusive.

## I see double squiggles for Undefined, Ambiguous Steps or Syntax Errors
**Symptom:** Your feature file displays two overlapping underlines (e.g., one yellow, one red) for the same undefined step, ambiguous step, or syntax error (such as a misspelled keyword). The generic `Syntax Error` might also mask the Quick Fix bulb.
**Likely Causes:** Both the realtime Linter and the BDD Anti-pattern Detection Engine are configured to report on the same file, but the filtering mechanism failed or configuration is conflicting.
**Diagnostic Steps:** Check if `"gherkinPowerTools.antiPatterns.enabled": true` is set. The Anti-pattern Diagnostics Manager is designed to automatically filter out `undefined-steps`, `ambiguous-steps`, and `syntax-errors` from visual editor diagnostics to prevent conflicts with the realtime Linter (which provides the highly-granular Quick Fixes).
**Resolution:** This should be handled automatically by the extension (as of version 1.8.7). If you still see it, try reloading the VS Code window, or temporarily set the conflicting rule to `"off"` in `gherkinPowerTools.rules`.

## Diagnostic suppression (Ignore this error) doesn't seem to work
**Symptom:** You clicked "Ignore this error" on a diagnostic (like `oversized-scenario`), but the warning still appears.
**Likely Causes:** In older versions, suppressions were strictly case-sensitive and didn't support multi-root workspaces correctly.
**Resolution:** Upgrade to version 1.8.6+. Suppressions are now safely canonicalized across macOS and Windows, and properly scoped to the active workspace folder. Check your `.gherkin-pt-suppressions.json` in the root of the specific workspace folder.

## Rule Configuration (like maxSteps) is ignored
**Symptom:** You configured a rule like `oversized-scenario` to use a custom threshold (e.g. `maxSteps: 20`), but the engine still uses the default threshold.
**Likely Causes:** You might have used the legacy string-based format or incorrectly nested the object.
**Resolution:** Ensure you are using the Object-based configuration correctly in `gherkinPowerTools.rules`. It must look like this:
```json
"gherkinPowerTools.rules": {
    "oversized-scenario": {
        "severity": "warning",
        "maxSteps": 20
    }
}
```

## Yellow line (diagnostics) doesn't appear immediately on file open
**Symptom:** You open a feature file and the yellow squiggly lines for undefined or ambiguous steps do not appear until you type a character or switch files back and forth.
**Resolution:** This behavior was fixed in v1.8.4. The real-time Linter now triggers `immediateLint` directly on file load, bypassing standard debounce delays. Ensure you are on the latest version of the extension.

## Quick Fix (Lightbulb) does not apply or fails silently
**Symptom:** You click a Quick Fix (e.g. to generate an undefined step or fix a misspelled keyword) and nothing happens.
**Likely Causes:** You continued typing in the `.feature` file *after* the diagnostic appeared but *before* you clicked the lightbulb.
**Resolution:** To protect against code corruption, Gherkin PowerTools strictly validates the document version. If the document has changed since the diagnostic was generated, the Code Action is aborted to prevent applying a stale edit. Wait a half-second for the linter to re-evaluate the file and generate a fresh Quick Fix lightbulb, then click it.

## Impact Analysis CodeLenses are not appearing
**Symptom:** You open a Python step definition file, but you do not see the CodeLenses displaying the number of affected scenarios.
**Likely Causes:** The feature is disabled in settings, or the `WorkspaceGraph` is still indexing the feature files.
**Diagnostic Steps:** Check if `"gherkinPowerTools.impactAnalysis.enabled": true` is set in your configuration. Wait for the workspace indexing to complete.
**Resolution:** Enable the setting and ensure your `.feature` files and Python files are correctly mapped in your `stepGlobs`.

## Generated step location is wrong or prompts for a workspace folder
**Symptom:** The Quick Fix generates a step, but places it in a file you didn't expect, or it asks you to select a workspace folder from a dropdown menu.
**Likely Causes:** The extension tries to append the new step to the most recently modified `.py` file within your `stepGlobs` paths. If you have no step files, it will create one based on standard conventions.
If you are in a **Multi-Root Workspace**, and the feature file being edited does not clearly belong to one of the roots, it will explicitly prompt you to select the correct target folder to prevent accidental cross-project modifications.
**Resolution:** Open the specific `steps.py` file you want to use, save it, and try generating the step again. The extension will pick up that file as the active target. If prompted for a folder, explicitly choose the intended project root.

**Symptom:** Step definition generation aborts safely and shows an error message like "Cannot read target file" instead of inserting the new step.
**Likely Causes:** The target Python file exists but is unreadable (e.g., due to strict filesystem permissions or a temporarily disconnected remote filesystem like SSH/WSL).
**Resolution:** This is a deliberate safety mechanism to prevent the extension from assuming the file is empty and injecting conflicting boilerplate. Verify your file permissions and remote connection status, then try generating the step again.

## Test Explorer and Debugging

## Test Explorer is empty
**Symptom:** You open the Testing sidebar, but no feature files or scenarios appear.
**Likely Causes:** The extension hasn't finished indexing, or there are no valid `.feature` files in the workspace.
**Diagnostic Steps:**
Wait a few seconds for the lazy-initialization to complete. If it still doesn't appear, ensure your `.feature` files contain valid Gherkin syntax (at least a `Feature:` keyword).
**Resolution:** Fix any critical syntax errors in your Gherkin.

## Test Execution is Blocked (Untrusted Workspace or External File)
**Symptom:** You attempt to run a test from the Test Explorer or CodeLens, but VS Code blocks the execution or throws a "Cannot run Behave against a file outside of a workspace folder" error.
**Likely Causes:**

1. The extension uses VS Code's Workspace Trust API. If your workspace is marked as "Untrusted" (Restricted Mode), test execution is disabled.
2. The `.feature` file you are trying to run is located outside of your currently open workspace folders (e.g. opened loosely or as an Untitled file).

**Resolution:**

1. Click the "Restricted Mode" banner in the bottom status bar and select "Trust Workspace & Install" to enable test execution.
2. Ensure you have explicitly opened the root folder containing the `.feature` file via **File > Open Folder...**. The extension strictly prevents execution on external files to protect your root disk from arbitrary runs.

## Run fails (Behave executable is not found)
**Symptom:** You click "Play" in the Test Explorer, but the test immediately fails with a "Command not found" or "behave is not recognized" error in the output.
**Likely Causes:** `behave` is not installed, or your virtual environment is not active in the shell that VS Code spawns.
**Resolution:**
If using a virtual environment manager like Poetry or Pipenv, update your configuration in `.gherkin-powertoolsrc.json` or `.vscode/settings.json`:
```json
"gherkinPowerTools.behave.execution": {
    "executable": "poetry",
    "arguments": ["run", "behave"]
}
```
If you need to point to a specific local Python virtual environment via an absolute path, configure the machine-specific override in your global User Settings to prevent committing absolute paths to your repository:
```json
"gherkinPowerTools.behave.localExecutable": "/absolute/path/to/.venv/bin/behave"
```

## Debugging does not stop at breakpoints
**Symptom:** You click the "Debug" icon, the test runs, but it ignores your red breakpoints.
**Likely Causes:** The Python extension is missing, or the debug session failed to attach to the `behave` process.
**Resolution:**
1. Ensure the official Microsoft Python extension is installed and active.
2. Ensure you clicked the **Debug (Bug icon)** in the Test Explorer, not the **Run (Play icon)**.

## Live Step Tracking animation is not visible
**Symptom:** The scenario runs in the Test Explorer, but the active step is not highlighted in the editor.
**Likely Causes:** The custom Formatter isn't emitting `step_start` events, or the file is not currently focused.
**Resolution:** Ensure your `behave` process has not overridden the custom JSON formatter, and verify that the `.feature` file you are running is currently open and active in the editor.

## Syntax Errors cascade into massive false-positives
**Symptom:** You missed a colon on a `Scenario`, and suddenly all steps below it have red underlines.
**Likely Causes:** This was a known limitation of the AST parser in older versions.
**Resolution:** Upgrade to version 1.7.9+. The linter now gracefully falls back to a text-based scanner to isolate severe structural errors from your valid steps.

## Statistics history data is lost or corrupted
**Symptom:** The historical trend charts are missing data points or show errors.
**Likely Causes:** State corruption or an extreme refactoring drastically altering the codebase.
**Resolution:**
1. Run the **Clear History** command to purge corrupted records safely.
2. The dashboard will start generating a fresh baseline on the next run.

## Remote Development (WSL, SSH, Dev Containers, Codespaces)
**Symptom:** The extension cannot find Python, Behave, or local workspace paths when running inside a remote environment.
**Likely Causes:** Gherkin PowerTools correctly executes on the remote machine where the workspace is hosted (as a `workspace` extension). Absolute paths configured for a local OS (e.g., Windows `C:\...`) will fail when the extension evaluates them on the Linux remote host.
**Resolution:**
1. Ensure your `gherkinPowerTools.behave.localExecutable` or `python.defaultInterpreterPath` uses the path inside the remote environment.
2. Ensure you have installed the Behave dependencies on the remote host/container.
3. If using the CLI (`npx @carlos-camara/gherkin-pt`), ensure you run it from the **Integrated Terminal** in VS Code, which is connected to your remote environment, rather than your local OS terminal.

## Statistics are empty or incomplete
**Symptom:** The Project Statistics dashboard shows 0 features.
**Likely Causes:** The workspace indexer was interrupted, or you opened the dashboard immediately upon launching VS Code before the 2-second background scan completed.
**Resolution:** Wait a few seconds, then close and reopen the dashboard.

## Large workspace performance is poor
**Symptom:** VS Code feels slow when typing in `.feature` files.
**Likely Causes:** The extension is scanning too many files (e.g., inside `.venv` or `node_modules`), or the AST Cache memory budget is constantly thrashing on massive files.
**Resolution:**
1. Ensure `gherkinPowerTools.behave.ignoreGlobs` correctly ignores all dependency directories.
2. Enable `gherkinPowerTools.diagnostics.metricsEnabled` and run the **Show Developer Metrics** command to identify if specific files have high parsing durations, poor cache hit ratios, or if **Cache Evictions** are rapidly exhausting the 50MB memory budget.

</div>

## Gherkin Health Dashboard is empty or incomplete
**Symptom:** You run "Show Gherkin Health" but the dashboard says "0 Total Step Defs" or misses files you know exist.
**Likely Causes:** Your `gherkinPowerTools.behave.stepGlobs` configuration does not cover the locations of all your steps.
**Resolution:** Ensure your Python step paths are correctly set in settings (`gherkinPowerTools.behave.stepGlobs`). The proactive indexer will automatically scan them upon running the command.

## Rename Step does not find all usages
**Symptom:** You invoke the native VS Code `Rename Symbol` command (e.g., <kbd>F2</kbd>) on a Gherkin step, rename it, but some `.feature` files still use the old step name.
**Likely Causes:** The affected `.feature` files were not yet indexed in the `WorkspaceGraph`, or the Workspace Graph failed to initialize.
**Diagnostic Steps:**

1. Ensure the Python step file containing the definition is within your configured `stepGlobs`.
2. Run **Gherkin PowerTools: Diagnose Workspace** and check the **Bootstrap Capabilities** section. If the `Workspace Graph` shows a `failed` state, review the error message provided.

    <div align="center">

    </div>

3. Check the "Discovered Steps" section.
**Resolution:** Verify `stepGlobs` covers all relevant step files. If a capability failed, you can restart the extension Host. The graph is rebuilt automatically when files are saved.

## Rename Step is not visible in the Context Menu
**Symptom:** You right-click in the editor, but "Rename Step" does not appear in the Gherkin PowerTools context submenu.
**Likely Causes:** To reduce clutter, the "Rename Step" command dynamically appears in the submenu only when your cursor is positioned directly on a valid step line.
**Resolution:** Ensure your text cursor is placed on a line starting with `Given`, `When`, `Then`, `And`, or `But`, then right-click and check the Gherkin PowerTools submenu again.

## Extract Step does not produce a Python stub
**Symptom:** You select multiple steps and invoke the Code Action, but no stub appears in the target file.
**Likely Causes:** The selection may not span multiple step lines, or no Python step files were found in the workspace.
**Diagnostic Steps:**
1. Ensure you have selected at least two step lines (the selection must include both start and end lines).
2. Confirm that at least one Python step file exists within your `stepGlobs`.
**Resolution:** If no Python files appear in the file picker, add the correct glob to `gherkinPowerTools.behave.stepGlobs`.

## VS Code Freezes or Stutters on Massive Feature Files

**Symptom:** Opening or pasting a massive `.feature` file (e.g., > 1MB of pure scenarios, such as > 10,000 scenarios generated automatically) causes VS Code to freeze or stutter for a brief moment, and the Extension Host might report unresponsiveness.

**Why it happens:** The native `@cucumber/gherkin` parser runs synchronously on the Extension Host main thread. For a typical file (under 1,000 scenarios), this takes `< 20ms` and is unnoticeable. For pathologically large files (> 10,000 scenarios), parsing can block the event loop for `> 75ms`.

**Resolution:**
- Break generated `.feature` files into smaller files (< 1,000 scenarios each).
- The extension employs *debouncing* to avoid running the parser on every keystroke, but initial loads or large pastes will block the thread until parsing finishes.
- A hard document-size guard (e.g., 2MB) may be implemented in future versions if abuse is widespread.

## Files are missed or falsely flagged as duplicates (macOS/Windows)
**Symptom:** When scanning large workspaces, some `.feature` or `.py` files are ignored, or Behave step definitions are falsely reported as duplicated.
**Likely Causes:** In earlier versions, case-insensitive file systems could cause path mismatches inside the internal graph.
**Resolution:** Ensure you are running version 1.8.2 or newer, which includes robust case-insensitive URI normalization for macOS and Windows.

## I accidentally dismissed a Contextual Recommendation
**Symptom:** You clicked "Don't show again" on a helpful popup (like the Formatting or Dashboard recommendation) and want it back.
**Likely Causes:** The extension saved your dismissal in the workspace state.
**Resolution:** Run the **Gherkin PowerTools: Reset Contextual Recommendations** command from the Command Palette to clear dismissals and allow helpful prompts to appear again.

## Standalone CLI fails to resolve dependencies
**Symptom:** Running `npx @carlos-camara/gherkin-pt analyze` fails with a "Cannot find module '@cucumber/gherkin'" error.
**Likely Causes:** The CLI was installed globally or npm cached an outdated, non-scoped version of the CLI package.
**Resolution:** Ensure you are using the explicitly scoped package (`@carlos-camara/gherkin-pt`) and force a cache clear by running `npx --yes --clear-cache @carlos-camara/gherkin-pt`.

## Formatter or Parser fails to load entirely
**Symptom:** Formatting, diagnostics, and step generation suddenly stop working, and the VS Code Output Channel (Gherkin PowerTools) displays "Failed to load Cucumber modules after 3 retries".
**Likely Causes:** Extremely slow Extension Host initialization or temporary filesystem locks preventing the loading of `@cucumber/gherkin` and `@cucumber/messages` modules.
**Resolution:** The parser attempts to heal itself by retrying up to 3 times. If all retries are exhausted, you can manually force a reload of the VS Code window (`Developer: Reload Window`). This is exceedingly rare in production builds (VSIX) but can happen during local development.

## How to Report a Bug
If none of these steps resolve your issue, please run **Gherkin PowerTools: Diagnose Workspace**, copy the output, and [Report an Issue on GitHub](https://github.com/carlos-camara/vscode-gherkin-powertools/issues).
